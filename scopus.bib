abstract={In this paper, we present the Promethee methods, a new class of outranking methods in multicriteria analysis. Their main features are simplicity, clearness and stability. The notion of generalized criterion is used to construct a valued outranking relation. All the parameters to be defined have an economic signification, so that the decision maker can easily fix them. Two ways of treatment are proposed: It is possible to obtain either a partial preorder (Promethee I) or a complete one (Promethee II), both on a finite set of feasible actions. A comparison is made with the Electre III method. The stability of the results given by the two methods is analysed. Numerical applications are given in order to illustrate the properties of the new methods and some further problems are discussed. © 1986.},

The VIKOR method is extended with a stability analysis determining the weight stability intervals and with trade-offs analysis. The extended VIKOR method is compared with three multicriteria decision making methods: TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and ELECTRE.

abstract={Several methods have been proposed for solving multi-attribute decision making problems (MADM). A major criticism of MADM is that different techniques may yield different results when applied to the same problem. The problem considered in this study consists of a decision matrix input of N criteria weights and ratings of L alternatives on each criterion. The comparative performance of some methods has been investigated in a few, mostly field, studies. In this simulation experiment we investigate the performance of eight methods: ELECTRE, TOPSIS, Multiplicative Exponential Weighting (MEW), Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and four versions of AHP (original vs. geometric scale and right eigenvector vs. mean transformation solution). Simulation parameters are the number of alternatives, criteria and their distribution. The solutions are analyzed using twelve measures of similarity of performance. Similarities and differences in the behavior of these methods are investigated. Dissimilarities in weights produced by these methods become stronger in problems with few alternatives; however, the corresponding final rankings of the alternatives vary across methods more in problems with many alternatives. Although less significant, the distribution of criterion weights affects the methods differently. In general, all AHP versions behave similarly and closer to SAW than the other methods. ELECTRE is the least similar to SAW (except for closer matching the top-ranked alternative), followed by MEW. TOPSIS behaves closer to AHP and differently from ELECTRE and MEW, except for problems with few criteria. A similar rank-reversal experiment produced the following performance order of methods: SAW and MEW (best), followed by TOPSIS, AHPs and ELECTRE. It should be noted that the ELECTRE version used was adapted to the common MADM problem and therefore it did not take advantage of the method's capabilities in handling problems with ordinal or imprecise information. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Sustainability assessments require the management of a wide variety of information types, parameters and uncertainties. Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been regarded as a suitable set of methods to perform sustainability evaluations as a result of its flexibility and the possibility of facilitating the dialogue between stakeholders, analysts and scientists. However, it has been reported that researchers do not usually properly define the reasons for choosing a certain MCDA method instead of another. Familiarity and affinity with a certain approach seem to be the drivers for the choice of a certain procedure. This review paper presents the performance of five MCDA methods (i.e. MAUT, AHP, PROMETHEE, ELECTRE and DRSA) in respect to ten crucial criteria that sustainability assessments tools should satisfy, among which are a life cycle perspective, thresholds and uncertainty management, software support and ease of use. The review shows that MAUT and AHP are fairly simple to understand and have good software support, but they are cognitively demanding for the decision makers, and can only embrace a weak sustainability perspective as trade-offs are the norm. Mixed information and uncertainty can be managed by all the methods, while robust results can only be obtained with MAUT. ELECTRE, PROMETHEE and DRSA are non-compensatory approaches which consent to use a strong sustainability concept, accept a variety of thresholds, but suffer from rank reversal. DRSA is less demanding in terms of preference elicitation, is very easy to understand and provides a straightforward set of decision rules expressed in the form of elementary "if ... then ..." conditions. Dedicated software is available for all the approaches with a medium to wide range of results capability representation. DRSA emerges as the easiest method, followed by AHP, PROMETHEE and MAUT, while ELECTRE is regarded as fairly difficult. Overall, the analysis has shown that most of the requirements are satisfied by the MCDA methods (although to different extents) with the exclusion of management of mixed data types and adoption of life cycle perspective which are covered by all the considered approaches. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Classification algorithm selection is an important issue in many disciplines. Since it normally involves more than one criterion, the task of algorithm selection can be modeled as multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. Different MCDM methods evaluate classifiers from different aspects and thus they may produce divergent rankings of classifiers. The goal of this paper is to propose an approach to resolve disagreements among MCDM methods based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Five MCDM methods are examined using 17 classification algorithms and 10 performance criteria over 11 public-domain binary classification datasets in the experimental study. The rankings of classifiers are quite different at first. After applying the proposed approach, the differences among MCDM rankings are largely reduced. The experimental results prove that the proposed approach can resolve conflicting MCDM rankings and reach an agreement among different MCDM methods. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Shortcomings of current waste management models include that they are concerned with refinements of the evaluation steps (e.g. stage four of AHP or the improvement of weight allocations in ELECTRE) rather than addressing the decision making process itself. In addition, while many models recognise that for a waste management model to be sustainable, it must consider environmental, economic and social aspects, no model examined considered all three aspects together in the application of the model. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In a decision aiding context, knowing the preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) and determining weights of criteria are very hard questions. Several methods can be used to give an appropriate value to the weights of criteria. J. Simos proposed a very simple procedure, using a set of cards, allowing to determine indirectly numerical values for weights. The purpose of this paper is first to explain why the above method needs to be revised, and second, the revised version we propose. This new version takes into account a new kind of information from the DM and changes certain computing rules of the former method. A software has been implemented based on the revised Simos' procedure whose main features are presented in this paper. The new method has been applied to different real-life cases (public transportation problems, water resources problems, environment problems, etc); it proved to be successful. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Land-use planners often make complex decisions within a short period of time when they must take into account sustainable development and economic competitiveness. A set of land-use suitability maps would be very useful in this respect. Ideally, these maps should incorporate complex criteria integrating several stakeholders' points of view. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, a land suitability map for housing was realised for a small region of Switzerland. Geographical Information System technology was used to assess the criteria requested to define the suitability of land for housing. An example dealing with the evaluation of noise levels illustrates the initial steps of this procedure. Because the required criteria are heterogeneous and measured on various scales, an out-ranking multicriteria analysis method called ELECTRE-TRI was used. However, using it to assess the suitability of any point in a territory was impractical due to computational limitations. Therefore, a mathematical function to evaluate closeness relationships and classify the study area into homogeneous zones was used. This function is compatible with the outranking function of ELECTRE-TRI used to assess the suitability index. The resulting maps lend efficient support to negotiation and are very useful in dealing with inherent conflicts in land-use planning.},

abstract={The ELECTRE II and III methods enjoy a wide acceptance in solving multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Research results in this paper reveal that there are some compelling reasons to doubt the correctness of the proposed rankings when the ELECTRE II and III methods are used. In a typical test we first used these methods to determine the best alternative for a given MCDM problem. Next, we randomly replaced a non-optimal alternative by a worse one and repeated the calculations without changing any of the other data. Our computational tests revealed that sometimes the ELECTRE II and III methods might change the indication of the best alternative. We treat such phenomena as rank reversals. Although such ranking irregularities are well known for the additive variants of the AHP method, it is the very first time that they are reported to occur when the ELECTRE methods are used. These two methods are also evaluated in terms of two other ranking tests and they failed them as well. Two real-life cases are described to demonstrate the occurrence of rank reversals with the ELECTRE II and III methods. Based on the three test criteria presented in this paper, some computational experiments on randomly generated decision problems were executed to test the performance of the ELECTRE II and III methods and an examination of some real-life case studies are also discussed. The results of these examinations show that the rates of the three types of ranking irregularities were rather significant in both the simulated decision problems and the real-life cases studied in this paper. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a valuable resource within operations research and management science. Various MCDA methods have been developed over the years and applied to decision problems in many different areas. The outranking approach, and in particular the family of ELECTRE methods, continues to be a popular research field within MCDA, despite its more than 40 years of existence. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of English scholarly papers on ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods is performed. Our aim is to investigate how ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods have been considered in various areas. This includes area of applications, modifications to the methods, comparisons with other methods, and general studies of the ELECTRE methods. Although a significant amount of literature on ELECTRE is in a language different from English, we focus only on English articles, because many researchers may not be able to perform a study in some of the other languages. Each paper is categorized according to its main focus with respect to ELECTRE, i.e. if it considers an application, performs a review, considers ELECTRE with respect to the problem of selecting an MCDA method or considers some methodological aspects of ELECTRE. A total of 686 papers are included in the review. The group of papers considering an application of ELECTRE consists of 544 papers, and these are further categorized into 13 application areas and a number of sub-areas. In addition, all papers are classified according to the country of author affiliation, journal of publication, and year of publication. For the group of applied papers, the distribution by ELECTRE version vs. application area and ELECTRE version vs. year of publication are provided. We believe that this paper can be a valuable source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field of MCDA and ELECTRE in particular. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

abstract={Given a finite set of alternatives, the sorting problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method ELECTRE TRI. This method requires the elicitation of parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits,...) in order to construct the Decision Maker's (DM) preference model. A direct elicitation of these parameters being rather difficult, we proceed to solve this problem in a way that requires from the DM much less cognitive effort. We elicit these parameters indirectly using holistic information given by the DM through assignment examples. We propose an interactive approach that infers the parameters of an ELECTRE TRI model from assignment examples. The determination of an ELECTRE TRI model that best restitutes the assignment examples is formulated through an optimization problem. The interactive aspect of this approach lies in the possibility given to the DM to revise his/her assignment examples and/or to give additional information before the optimization phase restarts.},

The Electre III method proved useful, especially when dealing with environmental problems involving many decision-makers, and in cases where the outcomes of the various alternatives remain to some degree uncertain. One of the main conclusions of our study is that all the proper landfill capacity available in the planning region should be used up. In addition, the energy potential of waste should be utilized within the region. Therefore, the solution recommended for a solid waste management system was intermediate landfilling, composting and RFD-combustion. The decision-makers commented positively on the method used and were satisfied with the options recommended. The scheme will be implemented for use from the beginning of the year 1995. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Multiobjective optimization in water resources planning consists in trading off noncommensurable objectives within the framework of a complex and dynamic process. Multiobjective optimization is performed at two levels: first, an engineering level, which may be labeled a decision‐making aid phase; and then, a managerial level of acceptance of the solution. The engineering level optimization may be performed by means of a cost‐effectiveness approach followed by the application of compromise programing, which consists of choosing a compromise solution located as close as possible to an ideal but non‐feasible solution. In this paper this combined method is applied to the design of a water resources system in the Central Tisza River Basin in Hungary. The results obtained by following this approach are compared to those in David and Duckstein (1976) and Keeney and Wood (1977), who used, respectively ELECTRE and multiattribute utility theory instead of compromise programing to study the same basin. The proposed methodology is able to lead to either one of the two different decisions resulting from the other studies. A brief discussion of possible approaches for final choice of alternative system is given. Key words in this paper are multiobjective optimization, decision‐making aid, cost‐effectiveness approach, compromise programing, and river basin development.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems with interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs). First, the concept, operational laws, score function, and accuracy function of IVPFSs are defined. Then, based on the operational laws, two interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy aggregation operators are developed for aggregating the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy information, such as interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy weighted average (IVPFWA) operator and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy weighted geometric (IVPFWG) operator. A series of inequalities of aggregation operators are studied. Later, we develop some interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy point operators. Moreover, combining the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy point operators with IVPFWA operator, we present some interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy point weighted averaging (IVPFPWA) operators, which can adjust the degree of the aggregated arguments with some parameters. Then, we propose an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE method to solve uncertainty MAGDM problem. Finally, an illustrative example for evaluating the software developments is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Many real-world decision problems involve conflicting systems of criteria, uncertainty and imprecise information. Some also involve a group of decision makers (DMs) where a reduction of different individual preferences on a given set to a single collective preference is required. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a widely used decision methodology that can improve the quality of group multiple criteria decisions by making the process more explicit, rational and efficient. One family of MCDA models uses what is known as "outranking relations" to rank a set of actions. The Electre method and its derivatives are prominent outranking methods in MCDA. In this study, we propose an alternative fuzzy outranking method by extending the Electre I method to take into account the uncertain, imprecise and linguistic assessments provided by a group of DMs. The contribution of this paper is fivefold: (1) we address the gap in the Electre literature for problems involving conflicting systems of criteria, uncertainty and imprecise information; (2) we extend the Electre I method to take into account the uncertain, imprecise and linguistic assessments; (3) we define outranking relations by pairwise comparisons and use decision graphs to determine which action is preferable, incomparable or indifferent in the fuzzy environment; (4) we show that contrary to the TOPSIS rankings, the Electre approach reveals more useful information including the incomparability among the actions; and (5) we provide a numerical example to elucidate the details of the proposed method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present main characteristics of ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité - ELimination and Choice Expressing the REality) family methods, designed for multiple criteria decision aiding. These methods use as a preference model an outranking relation on the set of actions-it is constructed in result of concordance and nondiscordance tests involving a specific input preference information. After a brief description of the constructivist conception in which the ELECTRE methods are inserted, we present the main features of these methods. We discuss such characteristic features as the possibility of taking into account positive and negative reasons in the modelling of preferences, without requiring commensurable performance scales; the use of discriminating thresholds for taking into account the imperfect knowledge of data; the absence of systematic compensation between 'gains' and 'losses'. The main weaknesses are also presented. Then, some aspects related to new developments are outlined. These are related to some new methodological developments, new procedures, axiomatic analysis, software tools and several other aspects.

abstract={Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are becoming increasingly popular in solving energy selection problems because these problems involve multiple and often conflicting criteria. This paper presents comparative analysis of ranking renewable energy sources (RES) for electricity generation in Taiwan using four MCDM methods - WSM, VIKOR, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE. The Shannon entropy weight method is used to assess the importance of each criterion for the ranking of RES. After that, four MCDM methods are utilized for quantitative evaluation to rank all available RE alternatives. From the weights estimation results, efficiency is the first priority in all evaluation criteria, followed by job creation, operation, and maintenance cost. The purpose of this study is to rank the priorities of various RES and propose recommendations for Taiwan's RE development. The ranking results show that hydro is the best alternative in Taiwan, followed by solar, wind, biomass and geothermal. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the weights was conducted considering the ranking results heavily depend on the criteria weight. The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that when financial or technical aspects are focused upon, hydropower is the best RES because its technology is the most mature and the cost is the lowest in Taiwan. In addition, from an environmental perspective, wind energy is the best choice, and from the social perspective, solar PV is the best choice. The findings of this study can provide useful information to energy decision makers and serve as a reference for Taiwan's energy policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The main characteristic feature of ELECTRE TRI Assistant is the inference of the ELECTRE TRI preferential parameters from assignment examples supplied by the DM. The software is presented through an illustrative example. Scope and purpose Decision makers (DMs) often face decision situations in which different conflicting viewpoints (goals or criteria) are to be considered. The field of multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) offers the DMs a selection of methods and operational tools that explicitly account for the diversity of the viewpoints considered. Each method constructs first a model of DM's preferences and then exploits this model in order to workout a recommendation. A large class of methods proposed in the literature use an outranking relation as a preference model (whose semantic is 'at least as good as'). In order to implement these methods in real-world applications, the values of preference parameters, like importance coefficients and discrimination thresholds, are to be given by the DM. As this is usually a difficult task, we propose to infer values of these parameters from examples of decisions supplied by the DM. Such an approach to preference modeling is called aggregation/disaggregation approach. The paper describes an implementation of an outranking method integrating this kind of preference elicitation support. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract={The present paper gives an analysis of the use of ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE I, II, and SMART decision-aids in the context of four different real applications to environmental problems in Finland. These methods are widely used decision-aids in the real planning processes. The purpose of this study is to define the differences of these methods and the results obtained with them, and in this way also to consider their applicability in aiding environmental decision-making. Furthermore, a comparison of the methods based on a set of randomly generated problems is carried out. The choice in practice will not be easy; PROMETHEE does not differ much from SMART with linear value functions, and in many cases this holds for ELECTRE III, too. However, in a particular problem the 'best alternatives' obtained with these methods may differ greatly. Therefore, the conclusion is that it is better to use several methods for the same problem when possible; when not, we recommend the use of ELECTRE III. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Group decision is usually understood as the reduction of different individual preferences on a given set to a single collective preference. At present, there are few approaches which solve the group ranking problem with multiple criteria in a widely acceptable way. Often, they rest on a poor heuristic which makes a decision about consensus ranking difficult to support. This paper presents an extension of the ELECTRE III multicriteria outranking methodology to assist a group of decision makers with different value systems to achieve a consensus on a set of possible alternatives. Our proposal starts with N individual rankings and N corresponding valued preference functions, and uses the natural heuristic provided by ELECTRE methodology for obtaining a fuzzy binary relation representing the collective preference. A comparison of this method with PROMETHEE II for group decision is carried out. We found that, in this particular application, the proposed heuristic based on majority rules combined with concessions to significant minorities, performs relatively better than a compensatory scheme based on a net flow weighted sum function. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={In the past, the choice among alternative energy policies at regional level was based only on cost minimization. Lately, it is widely recognized that regional energy planning forms a multi-actor and multicriteria problem. This is particularly true in the case of power generation in regions presenting high rates of increase in electricity demand, together with a significant potential of renewable energy sources, since several and often conflicting points of view must be taken into account. In this paper, the contribution of a Multicriteria Decision Aid method -namely ELECTRE III - addressing in such problems is investigated through the examination of a particular case study in a Greek island. Through the presentation of the procedure followed (identification of actors, selection of criteria, formulation of alternative strategies, application of the specific method and analysis of results and actors' reactions), an effort is made to highlight those aspects that are crucial in reaching a compromise in regional energy planning problems. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Structuring problems for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective. This is reflected in a significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi-criteria analysis. The problem structuring approaches (PSMs) include general methodologies such as Checkland's Soft Systems Method (SSM), Eden and Ackermann's Strategic Options Design and Analysis (SODA) and other methods that focus on a particular aspect. We carried out a literature review that covers eight PSMs (Cognitive and Causal Maps, DPSIR, Scenario Planning, SSM, Stakeholder Analysis, Strategic Choice Approach, SODA and SWOT) and seven MCDA methods (AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, MAUT, MAVT, PROMETHEE and TOPSIS). We first identified and analysed 333 articles published during 2000-2015, then selected 68 articles covering all PSM-MCDA combinations, which were studied in detail to understand the associated processes, benefits and challenges. The three PSMs most commonly combined with MCDA are SWOT, Scenario Planning and DPSIR. AHP was by far the most commonly applied MCDA method. Combining PSMs with MCDA produces a richer view of the decision situation and enables more effective support for different phases of the decision-making process. Some limitations and challenges in combining PSMs and MCDA are also identified, most importantly relating to building a value tree and assigning criteria weights. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper reports on an integration of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and inexact mixed integer linear programming (IMILP) methods to support selection of an optimal landfill site and a waste-flow-allocation pattern such that the total system cost can be minimized. Selection of a landfill site involves both qualitative and quantitative criteria and heuristics. In order to select the best landfill location, it is often necessary to compromise among possibly conflicting tangible and intangible factors. Different multi-objective programming models have been proposed to solve the problem. A weakness with the different multi-objective programming models used to solve the problem is that they are basically mathematical and ignore qualitative and often subjective considerations such as the risk of groundwater pollution as well as other environmental and socio-economic factors which are important in landfill selection. The selection problem also involves a change in allocation pattern of waste-flows required by construction of a new landfill. A waste flow refers to the routine of transferring waste from one location in a city to another. In selection of landfill locations, decision makers need to consider both the potential sites that should be used as well as the allocation pattern of the waste-flow at different periods of time. This paper reports on our findings in applying an integrated IMILP/MCDA approach for solving the solid waste management problem in a prairie city. The five MCDA methods of simple weighted addition, weighted product, co-operative game theory, TOPSIS, and complementary ELECTRE are adopted to evaluate the landfill site alternatives considered in the solid waste management problem, and results from the evaluation process are presented. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a well-known method to assign a set of alternatives to a set of predefined categories, considering multiple criteria. Using this method requires setting many parameters, which is often a difficult task. We consider the case where the decision makers (DMs) in the decision process are unsure of which values should each parameter take, which may result from uncertain, imprecise or inaccurately determined information, as well as from lack of consensus among them. This paper discusses the synergy between two approaches developed independently to deal with this difficulty. The first approach infers the value of parameters from assignment examples provided by the DMs, as an elicitation aid. Each assignment example originates mathematical constraints that the parameter values should satisfy. The second approach considers a set of constraints on the parameter values reflecting the imprecise information that the DMs are able to provide. Then, it computes the best and worst categories for each alternative compatible with constraints, in order to present robust conclusions. Both approaches avoid asking for precise values for the parameters. Rather, they proceed to solve the problem in a way that requires from the DMs much less effort. By integrating these two approaches, this paper proposes a new interactive approach, where the insight obtained during robustness analyses guides the DMs during the elicitation phase. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The optimisation of decentralised energy systems has to integrate a series of factors, by implementing an approach based on interdisciplinary comprehension. There are technical, financial, environmental and social conditions that determine the selection and dimensioning of energy systems, particularly if these aim at covering the demand of remote regions by utilising renewable energy sources. Such a study requests the overall consideration of the local geological, morphological and climatic conditions, the capacities of the networks, and also the inclusion of the economic and social limitations, an approach that leads to a number of alternative solutions. The application of multi-criteria analysis can integrate the various aspects into a uniform evaluation procedure. This paper discusses the results of a study on determining the achievable penetration of renewable energy sources into an insular system for the purpose of electricity generation. The multi-criteria analysis method Electre III was implemented for this purpose.

abstract={The material plays an important role in an engineering design process. The suitable material selection for a particular product is one of the vital tasks for the designers. In order to fulfil the product's end requirements, designers need to analyze the performance of various materials and spot suitable materials with precise functionalities. Due to the presence of large number of materials with diverse properties, the material selection process is complicated and time consuming task. There is a necessity of systematic and efficient approach towards material selection to choose best alternative material for a product. The aim of this paper is to describe the application of four Multi Criteria Decision Making methods for solving pipes material selection problem in sugar industry. FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR, FAHP-ELECTRE, FAHP-PROMTHEE are the four methods used to choose the best alternative among the various materials. The ranking performance of various MCDM methods is also compared with each other and exploring the effectiveness and flexibility of VIKOR method. Five stainless steel grades such as J4, JSLAUS, J204Cu, 409 M, 304 and seven evaluation criteria such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, percentage of elongation, hardness, cost, corrosion rate and wear rate are focussed in this study to choose the suitable material. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, a new sorting method, following a decision aiding constructive approach, is proposed. This method is called Electre Tri-C. As a sorting method, a set of categories must be defined to represent the way in which the actions that are going to be assigned to each of them should further be processed. This method is appropriate to deal with decision aiding contexts where the categories are completely ordered and each of them is defined through a single characteristic reference action. The set of characteristic actions should be co-constructed through an interactive process between the analyst and the decision maker. Electre Tri-C has been conceived to verify a set of natural structural requirements (conformity, homogeneity, monotonicity, and stability), which can be viewed as its fundamental properties. This method is composed of two joint rules, called descending rule and ascending rule, which must be used conjointly (and not separately). Each one of these rules selects only one category or a range of possible categories for a possible assignment of an action. This assignment depends on the comparison of such an action to the characteristic actions according to a chosen credibility level. Numerical examples are also presented in order to illustrate the main theoretical results provided by the method. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Selection of proper materials for different components is one of the most challenging tasks in the design and development of products for diverse engineering applications. Materials play a crucial and important role during the entire design and manufacturing process. Wrong selection of material often leads to huge cost involvement and ultimately drives towards premature component or product failure. So the designers need to identify and select proper materials with specific functionalities in order to obtain the desired output with minimum cost involvement and specific applicability. This paper attempts to solve the materials selection problem using two most potential multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches and compares their relative performance for a given material selection application. The first MCDM approach is 'Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje' (VIKOR), a compromise ranking method and the other one is 'ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality' (ELECTRE), an outranking method. These two methods are used to rank the alternative materials, for which several requirements are considered simultaneously. Two examples are cited in order to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of these two MCDM approaches. In each example, a list of all the possible choices from the best to the worst suitable materials is obtained taking into account different material selection criteria. The rankings of the selected materials almost corroborate with those as obtained by the past researchers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The approach allows various sources of uncertainty and is intended to provide a flexible form of group decision support. The example compares the ELECTRE method with the fuzzy compromise approach. The comparison is intended to demonstrate the benefits of adopting a multicriteria decision analysis technique which presents subjectivity within its proper context while maintaining an intuitive and transparent technique for ranking alternatives. The fuzzy compromise approach allows a family of possible conditions to be reviewed, and supports group decisions through fuzzy sets designed to reflect collective opinions and conflicting judgements. Ranking of alternatives is accomplished with fuzzy ranking measures designed to illustrate the effect of risk tolerance differences among decision makers. Two distinct ranking measures are used - a centroid measure, and a fuzzy comparison measure based on a fuzzy goal. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Adoption of sustainability has become extremely essential aspect over the last decade for the industries to sustain in the global market. However, the adoption of sustainability in supply chain is more concern for the manufacturing organisations. Constantly, changing market has insisted these organisations to revisit their supply chain activities in order to penetrate sustainability effectively through various practices such as lean, green, circular, and industry 4.0 etc. But, the lack of verified Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) frameworks has become a concern for the practitioners. Similarly, solutions required to overcome the SSCM adoption issues also need to be updated accordingly to changing business environments. So, the present study aims to develop a framework to overcome SSCM challenges through industry 4.0 and circular economy based solution measures. This study identifies a unique set of 28 SSCM challenges and 22 solution measures. Further, an automotive case organisation is used to test the applicability of the developed framework through hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM)- ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) approach. The inputs for BWM-ELECTRE approach is obtained by constructing an expert panel within the case organisation. Initial inputs are taken for BWM comparisons to compute the weight of SSCM challenges; whereas, further a comparison of challenges and solution measures is also obtained for ELECTRE approach to compute the final ranking of the solution measures to overcome SSCM challenges. The case findings reveal that managerial and organisational challenges and economic challenges emerge as most critical to SSCM adoption. The present study outcomes will be beneficial for researchers working in SSCM industry 4.0 and circular economy domain; whereas, the practitioners can use the prioritised solution measures to formulate effective strategies to overcome SSCM adoption failures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Offshore wind power projects have been rapidly proposed in China due to policy promotion. Site selection immensely decides the success of any offshore wind power development and is a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. However, canonical MCDM methods tend to fail the site selection process due to the following three problems. Firstly, the compensation problem exists in information processing. Secondly, there exists the problem of incomplete utilization of decision information and information loss in the decision process. Thirdly, the interaction problem in the fuzzy environment is easy to be ignored. To deal with the above problems, this study builds a framework for offshore wind farm site selection decision utilizing Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité-III (ELECTRE-III) in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. First of all, the comprehensive index system of OWPS site selection consisting of veto criteria and evaluation criteria is constructed. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy set is used in the group decision for the decision makers to express the imperfect knowledge. Moreover, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric interaction averaging (GIFWGIA) operator is applied to deal with the interaction problem. Together with the likelihood-based valued comparisons, imprecise decision information is reasonably used and information loss problem is rationally avoided. Then a case of China is studied based on the proposed framework, demonstrating the site selection methodology valid and practical. This study implements evaluation method for offshore wind power site selection and also provides a theoretical basis for the development of offshore wind power decision-making in China. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Replacing and selecting materials for different engineering applications is relatively common. It must be noted that in some cases, there is more than a single definite criterion for selecting the right kind of material. The designers and engineers have to take into account a large number of material selection criteria. Experts usually apply trial and error methods or build on previous experimentation. In this paper, a new approach has been carried out for the use of the ELECTRE: ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing the REality) model in material selection. By producing a material selection decision matrix and criteria sensitivity analysis, ELECTRE has been applied to obtain a more precise material selection for a particular application, including logical ranking of considered materials. A list of all possible choices from the best to the worst suitable materials can be obtained taking into account all the material selection criteria, including the cost of production. This work shows that ELECTRE can be used successfully in selecting a suitable material for the particular application of a loaded thermal conductor. There is good agreement between the results of the methods being used and available data in Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) databases. A computer program, Mathematica has been developed to facilitate the application of the method to other types of material selection problems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Along with data from industrial experts, six deterministic MCDM methods are studied, so as to determine the best alternative among the available options, assessed against selected criteria with a view toward assigning confidence levels to each option. Following an overview of the literature around MCDM problems, the best practice implementation of each method is presented aiming to assist stakeholders and decision-makers to support decisions in real-world applications, where many and often conflicting criteria are present within uncertain environments. The outcomes of this research highlight that more sophisticated methods, such as technique for the order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Preference Ranking Organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), better predict the optimum design alternative. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={Due to constant decrease in farmlands, it is important to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable). This requirement has resulted in the development of land suitability maps for agriculture by combining several factors of various natures and of differing importance. The integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis approaches (MCDA) in a Geographical Information System (GIS) provides a powerful spatial decision support system which offers the opportunity to efficiently produce these land suitability maps. Indeed, GIS is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data and establishing a process for decision support. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, MCDA methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account and decision-makers are in conflict (Dias et al., 2002). The parameters and the classification system used in this work are inspired from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) approach dedicated to a sustainable agriculture. A spatial decision support system has been developed for establishing the land suitability map for agriculture. It incorporates the multicriteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri (ELimitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) in a GIS (ArcGIS) within the GIS program package environment. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. A land suitability map for durum wheat has been produced. Through the obtained results, it appears that ELECTRE Tri method, integrated into ArcGIS 9.2 of ESRI, is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. The time saving during the development of the land suitability map for the agriculture of the durum wheat was considerable. The coherence of the obtained maps confirms the system effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The aim of this paper is to propose an environmental impact assessment methodology based on an integrated fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE approach in the context of urban industrial planning. In the proposed methodology the criteria weights are generated by a fuzzy AHP procedure. The fuzzy set theory is a perfect means for modeling uncertainty or imprecision arising from human mental phenomena. The usage of fuzzy sets in describing uncertainties and vagueness in different environmental factors simplifies the complex structure of EIA. A fuzzy outranking methodology, fuzzy ELECTRE is used to assess the environmental impact generated by the six different industrial districts which were predicted to shape the future industrial structure of Istanbul metropolitan area. Finally, a fuzzy dominance relation (FDR) methodology is used to rank the alternatives from the most risky to the least. A sensitivity analysis is also provided. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={On the background of economic globalisation, market competition is no longer the competition between enterprises, but it is the competition between supply chains. Supplier selection is the basis of supply chain cooperation, and is also the key factor to improve the competitive power of a supply chain. A novel method, which combines entropy weight and an improved ELECTRE-III method, is proposed to deal with supplier selection of supply chains. The research states at home and abroad are firstly analysed, and on the foundation of the relative literature, the indicator systems are constructed and the corresponding objective weight of each indicator based on entropy is calculated. Then the threshold is confirmed and the harmoniousness index and the unharmoniousness index are calculated. Next, the outranking relation is calculated and evaluated. Last, the suppliers are ranked based on the net advantage value of each project. Finally, the case analysis proves that the process of this method is clear and the application of it is convenient. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Given a finite set of alternatives A, the sorting (or assignment) problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method ELECTRE TRI. This method requires the elicitation of preferential parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits, ...) in order to construct a preference model which the decision maker (DM) accepts as a working hypothesis in the decision aid study. A direct elicitation of these parameters requiring a high cognitive effort from the DM, proposed an interactive aggregation-disaggregation approach that infers ELECTRE TRI parameters indirectly from holistic information, i.e., assignment examples. In this approach, the determination of ELECTRE TRI parameters that best restore the assignment examples is formulated through a nonlinear optimization program. In this paper, we consider the subproblem of the determination of the weights only (the thresholds and category limits being fixed). This subproblem leads to solve a linear program (rather than nonlinear in the global inference model). Numerical experiments were conducted so as to check the behaviour of this disaggregation tool. Results showed that this tool is able to infer weights that restores in a stable way the assignment examples and that it is able to identify `inconsistencies' in the assignment examples.},

The method used to determine which ones should be chosen for renovation, was reconsidered two years ago. A programming system, using updated data, now ranks by priority each year all the stations renovated. The ranking procedure uses Electre III. Each station is evaluated using seven criteria arising from the objectives and constraints of either the passengers or the RATP. For each criterion, indifference and preference thresholds are determined after establishing the relative importance of each criterion. A joint research contract was drawn up by Laboratoire d'Analyse et Modelisstion de Systémes pour l'Aide à la Décision (LANSADE, University of Paris) and, RATP for the implementation of the method. This study led to two critical developments in multicriteria methods: 1. - A method for obtaining the necessary information from RATP staff to quantify the relative importance of each criterion was rested; it led to the determination of the variation ranges of criteria 'weights'. 2. - A method to appraise the impact of imperfect information - which can take several forms - on the ranking was developed; it was applied to 32 sets of values. © 1986.},

abstract={The Region of Murcia has one of the highest percentages of potential solar radiation in Spain, which puts it in an excellent position to host electricity generation plants through photovoltaic solar systems, commonly known as solar farms. This paper proposes the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to identify the best plots suitable for installing photovoltaic solar farms in the Municipality of Torre Pacheco, in the southeast of Spain. The plots are classified according to multiple evaluation aspects, by developing a multicriteria model and applying the ELECTRE-TRI method using the Decision Support System IRIS. The combination of GIS and IRIS offers the user the possibility of using the information provided by the GIS mapping leading to an assignment of the feasible courses of action (the plots) to categories of merit according to multiple, conflicting and incommensurate evaluation criteria.The GIS provides a cartographic and alphanumeric database, including two factors of distinct nature: restrictions and criteria. The restrictions are entered into the GIS using layers defined from the current legislation (urban land, undeveloped land, special protection areas for birds, community sites, infrastructures, etc.), which reduce the study area by eliminating those areas in which photovoltaic solar farms cannot be implemented. The criteria are organized into a tree to be used for assessing the greater or lesser capacity to install photovoltaic solar farms. These criteria are introduced into the GIS, taking into account weather, environmental, location, and terrain evaluation aspects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The ELECTRE III outranking model is particularly suited to aiding the choice between project alternatives on the basis of mainly environmental criteria. The model requires values of three criterion thresholds, the indifference threshold (q), the preference threshold (p) and the veto threshold (v). These allow the uncertainties inherent in the criteria valuations to be incorporated into the decision process. There is, at present, a high degree of subjectivity involved in determining these thresholds, which are expressed in terms of the error/uncertainty associated with the valuations of each of the criteria under scrutiny. If, however, the ELECTRE III outranking model is to be used within a formal environmental appraisal system, the thresholds which govern the outranking relationship of one project option over another must take account of the effect on human beings of the difference between any two criterion scores. The authors suggest a new method for applying the standard ELECTRE III model to decision-aid problems within the formal mechanism of environmental impact assessment. This involves a new, more comprehensive approach for specifying realistic limits for p, q and v, within the context of an environmental appraisal, where both criterion error/uncertainty and human sensitivity to differing levels of the criterion are taken into account. Threshold valuations for noise impacts from a highway project are used to illustrate the proposed method. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The multi criteria decision making (MCDM) has been applied in Integrated Energy Planning (IEP) and Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) frameworks. In this paper, a novel hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) methodologies is applied to assist in the site selection of offshore wind farm (OWF) as the renewable energy in the IEP and the ICM frameworks. The aim of this study is to find the best site selection of offshore wind farm for four sites (alternatives) in Bandar Deylam on the Persian Gulf in southwest of Iran. Six criteria (depths and heights, environmental issues, proximity to facilities, economic aspects, resource technical levels and culture) and the related sub-criteria are considered to select proper sites for power station of OWF. The fuzzy ANP method is employed for standpoints of the site selection (goal) subject to the criteria and is performed the criteria subject to the sub-criteria. In addition, due to considering the influences of the criterion to another criterion, the fuzzy DEMATEL is employed in criteria and sub-criteria sections. Moreover, the fuzzy ELECTRE is applied to calculate the decision making matrices of sub-criteria to alternatives. The results show that the alternative A3 is the best site of OWF for Bandar Deylam. Then A2, A4 are the best alternatives and finally alternative A1 is the worst site. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the robustness of the outcomes of decision making by changing the priorities of the criteria. The results indicate the robustness of this method when the experts' opinions subject to the criteria change. The evaluation criteria and this methodology could be applied to other coastal cities for promoting the progress of ICM towards the goal of sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A major topic among the current researches on energy is a sustainable energy development and assessment. An importance of energy system is obvious in our life. There are many important energy applications. There are heating and cooling, power generation, desalination, air conditioning and so on. By the year 2020 world will need 50% more energy than today and the Asia-Pacific region will become world's largest consumer of energy. In 21-st century, world faces with the challenge of converting its fossil fuels energy base to the sustainable energy sources. Regarding the increasing rise of the energy demand and consumption, virtually everyone in the world must implement an integrated resource planning (IRP). It is vitally important to achieve sustainable growth.
Sustainability assessment of energy system is one of the important issues in policy making all around the world. Decision making on energy system is very risky and difficult and therefore cannot be individual. Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a renowned methodology in decision making and evaluation. Some of the most famous MCDM tools are as following: AHP, ANP, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, MUSA, AKUTA, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, SAW, MOORA, COPRAS, COPRAS-G, SWARA, FARE.
A Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method is one of the new MCDM methods presented in 2010. SWARA method is applied for some reasons in this paper. Firstly, SWARA’s perspective is different from other similar methods like AHP, ANP and FARE. SWARA gives the chance for decision and policy makers to select their priority based on the current situation of environment and economy. In this method, expert has an important role on evaluations and calculating weights. The ability to estimate experts’ opinion about importance ratio of the criteria is the main element of this method.
SWARA is developed for identifying importance of criteria and relative weights of each criterion. Current research applies SWARA as a new framework for evaluating and prioritizing sustainability assessment indicators of energy system. General indicator system consists of Resource Indicator, Environment Indicator, Economic Indicator and Social Indicator and their sub-criterions. For instance, complex environmental indicator consists of CO2, SO2 and NOX indicators while complex economic indicator consists of energy costs, investment and efficiency indicators. The research revealed that the most important indicator is Social (0.342). Then, the range of indicators is as following: Environmental (0.284), Economic (0.212) and Resource (0.162).
Finally, the research shows that this methodology can be useful as a framework to operate with sustainability assessment indicators of the energy system. Also, this methodology can be used for decision making in real issues of future researches in different areas. The results of this methodology also can be compared to other methods such as AHP and ANP. © 2013, Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics. All right reserved.},

abstract={We consider a framework where decision makers (DMs) interactively define a multicriteria evaluation model by providing imprecise information (i.e., a linear system of constraints to the model's parameters) and by analyzing the consequences of the information provided. DMs may introduce new constraints explicitly or implicitly (results that the model should yield). If a new constraint is incompatible with the previous ones, then the system becomes inconsistent and the DMs must choose between removing the new constraint or removing some of the older ones. We address the problem of identifying subsets of constraints which, when removed, lead to a consistent system. Identifying such subsets would indicate the reason for the inconsistent information given by DMs. There may exist several possibilities for the DMs to resolve the inconsistency. We present two algorithms to identify such possibilities, one using {0,1} mixed integer linear programming and the other one using linear programming. Both approaches are based on the knowledge that the system was consistent prior to introducing the last constraint. The output of these algorithms helps the DM to identify the conflicting pieces of information in a set of statements he/she asserted. The relevance of these algorithms for MCDA is illustrated by an application to an aggregation/disaggregation procedure for the Electre Tri method. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In supply chain management, supplier selection can be treated as a type of hierarchical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems since it involves various criteria and hierarchical structure among criteria often exists. This paper investigates a kind of MCDM problems with two-level criteria and develops a novel hybrid method integrating TL-ANP (2-tuple linguistic analytic network process) and IT-ELECTRE II (interval 2-tuple Elimination and Choice Translating Reality II). Considering interactions among criteria, a TL-ANP approach, in which comparison matrices are consistent 2-tuple linguistic preference relations, is put forward to determine weights of criteria and sub-criteria. To deal with the case of criteria being not compensated, an IT-ELECTRE II approach is proposed. In this approach, ratings of alternatives on sub-criteria are represented as interval 2-tuple linguistic variables. A possible degree and a likelihood-based preference degree are respectively defined, followed by concordance, discordance and indifferent sets. Afterwards, concordance and discordance indices are identified and applied to establish net concordance and net discordance indices. Further, comprehensive dominant values of alternatives are obtained to rank alternatives. Thereby, a novel hybrid method is presented for MCDM with two-level criteria under interval 2-tuple linguistic environment. At length, a real case of supplier selection is examined and comparison analyses are conducted to illustrate the application and superiority of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for treating uncertainty in the multi-criteria decision making process by introducing interval rough numbers (IRN). The IRN approach enables decision making using only the internal knowledge incorporated in the data provided by the decision maker. A hybrid multi-criteria model was developed based on IRN, and demonstrated using the example of the bidder selection process in the state administration public procurement procedure. The first segment of the hybrid model deals with the rough interval DEMATEL-ANP (IR'DANP) model, which enables more objective expert evaluation of criteria in a subjective environment than the traditional/crisp approach. In the second segment, the evaluation is enabled by applying the new rough interval MAIRCA method, which introduces mathematical tools and shows high stability concerning changes in the nature and characteristics of the criteria. The results of the hybrid IR'DANP-MAIRCA model were analyzed using 36 scenarios of sensitivity analysis, which showed high stability of the results. The results of the interval rough method were compared with the fuzzy extensions of the TOPSIS, VIKOR, MABAC, TODIM, ELECTRE I and DEMATEL-ANP models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

We formulate the approach by defining the concepts of hesitant fuzzy concordance and discordance sets and by constructing the strong and weak outranking relations, which are employed to decide the ranking for a set of alternatives. Numerical examples are presented to exhibit the applications of the proposed method. Furthermore, a comparison of the alternatives' rankings derived from the HF-ELECTRE II method with those derived from the aggregation operators and the fuzzy group ELECTRE approach is made. After that, a decision supporting system based on the HF-ELECTRE II method is constructed to aid decision making, and the prominent characteristics of the HF-ELECTRE II method and future research challenges are also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to design a new extension of the ELECTRE, known as the elimination and choice translating reality method, for multi-criteria group decision-making problems based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This method is widely utilized when a set of alternatives should be identified and evaluated with respect to a set of conflicting criteria by reflecting decision makers' (DMs') preferences. However, handling the exact data and numerical measure is difficult to be precisely focused because the DMs' judgments are often vague in real-life decision problems and applications. A more realistic and practical approach can be to use linguistic variables expressed in intuitionistic fuzzy numbers instead of numerical data to model DMs' judgments and to describe the inputs in the ELECTRE method. The proposed intuitionsitic fuzzy ELECTRE utilizes the truth-membership function and non-truth-membership function to indicate the degrees of satisfiability and non-satisfiability of each alternative with respect to each criterion and the relative importance of each criterion, respectively. Then, a new discordance intuitionistic index is introduced, which is extended from the concept of the fuzzy distance measure. Outranking relations are defined by pairwise comparisons and a decision graph is depicted to determine which alternative is preferable, incomparable or indifferent in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is employed to further study regarding the impact of threshold values on the final evaluation, and a comparative analysis is demonstrated with an application example in flexible manufacturing systems between the proposed ELECTRE method and the existing intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (IF-TOPSIS) method. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Multicriteria analysis methods have been used over the past decade for resolving environmental issues. This paper deals with the application of a multicriteria analysis (MCA) approach to urban stormwater drainage management. Stormwater source control has become a popular alternative solution for managing stormwater in urban areas. Source control constitutes one variant of best management practices (BMPs) that can be evaluated with respect to various criteria, including: hydraulic efficiency, pollution retention, environmental impact, operation and maintenance, economic investment, and social and sustainable urban living. A French survey was undertaken to assess the performance of different BMPs at the national scale; results highlight the main reasons justifying the use of BMPs. These reasons are primarily related to flood prevention, which far outweighs the economic incentives. Moreover, hydraulic and technical aspects are most frequently noted by users, whereas operation and maintenance aspects are often seen as obstacles to application of these techniques. The survey results, completed by a literature review and expert statements, have been used to establish a matrix of alternatives for multicriteria analysis. The MCA results obtained allow ranking the various alternatives from best to worst, taking into account the different strategies adopted by the decision-makers involved. The development of a multicriteria approach could, in the future, serve as a supporting decision-aid tool, whose purpose would be to guide users in their choice of stormwater source solution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a multiple criteria decision aiding sorting method with a history of successful real-life applications. In ELECTRE TRI, values for certain parameters have to be provided. We propose a new method, SMAA-TRI, that is based on stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA), for analyzing the stability of such parameters. The stability analysis can be used for deriving robust conclusions. SMAA-TRI allows ELECTRE TRI to be used with uncertain, arbitrarily distributed values for weights, the lambda cutting level, and profiles. The method consists of analyzing finite spaces of arbitrarily distributed parameter values. Monte Carlo simulation is applied in this in order to describe for each alternative the share of parameter values that have it assigned to different categories. We show the real-life applicability by re-analyzing a case study in the field of risk assessment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Two outranking methods, ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II, commonly used as decision-aid in various environmental problems, and their applications to decision support for natural resources management are presented. These methods represent 'the European school' of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), as opposed to 'the American school', represented by, for instance, the AHP method. On the basis of a case study, outranking methods are compared to so far more usually applied techniques based on the ideas of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). The outranking methods have been recommended for situations, where there is a finite number of discrete alternatives to be chosen among. The number of decision criteria and decision makers may be large. An important advantage of outranking methods, when compared to decision support techniques most often applied in today's natural resources management, is the ability to deal with ordinal and more or less descriptive information on the alternative plans to be evaluated. Furthermore, the uncertainty concerning the values of the criterion variables can be taken into account using fuzzy relations, determined by indifference and preference thresholds. The difficult interpretation of the results, on the other hand, is the main drawback of the outranking methods.},

abstract={Towards the end of a design process designers may face a number of candidate materials with different attributes that are difficult to distinguish with the aid of available databases. In such situations material selection of sensitive components is perhaps one of the most challenging problems in the design of structural elements in some industries such as aerospace. The selection process is often realized as a team-work task to enhance reliability of the chosen material. During group decision making, however, separations in design preferences can be encountered. Furthermore, there may be uncertainties in each designer's mind with regards to expressing his/her preferences over design criteria. This paper using a revised Simos' method with the ELECTRE III optimization model is an attempt to provide a decision aid framework that account for both of these effects. A post-aggregation strategy with an overall rank loss function is proposed to arrive at candidate materials that show the most stable and the highest ranks in a list of given candidates. To show the applicability of the approach, a sample case study in the material selection of a thermal loaded conductor cover sheet is conducted and validated by an available database. It is also illustrated that, using ELECTRE III, a non-compensatory aspect of material selection can be assumed while attaining a reasonable sensitivity to weight fluctuations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Proactive environmental management initiatives such as pollution prevention, cleaner production and sustainability are inherently multi-objective processes that require joint considerations of environmental, industrial, economic and social criteria in all stages of decision making. The success of such initiatives, however, depends on the solidity and the relevance of their strategic frameworks. This paper proposes strategic positioning of pollution prevention and clean production projects via design of a sustainable environmental management system (SEMS) that is responsive to regulatory requirements, and is relevant to industry culture and business structure. Built on the traditional and familiar environmental management system platform and the requirements of the multi-criteria decision making models ELECTRE III, the SEMS is capable of supporting design and implementation of defensible solutions to environmental problems industry face today according to sustainability criteria. The ELECTRE III model was selected as an integral part of the framework due to its ease of application, flexibility in design and selection of performance criteria, and capability to identify the best management solutions by giving an order of preference to multiple alternatives. The proposed SEMS framework is also in line with the Rio+20 sustainable development goals, objectives and guidelines that call for action and result-oriented strategies and institutional frameworks that could account for multiple stakeholders' key issues while suggesting environmental solutions according to the three dimensions of sustainable development. A case study that demonstrates the management of waste streams at a manufacturer of energy drinks and diet bars is provided to demonstrate how the SEMS can be designed and implemented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Classical approaches to layout design problem tend to maximise the efficiency of layout, measured by the handling cost related to the interdepartmental flow and to the distance among the departments. However, the actual problem involves several conflicting objectives hence requiring a multi-objective formulation. Multi-objective approaches, recently proposed, in most cases lead to the maximisation of a weighted sum of score functions. The poor practicability of such an approach is due to the difficulty of normalising these functions and of quantifying the weights. In this paper, this difficulty is overcome by approaching the problem in two subsequent steps: in the first step, the Pareto-optimal solutions are determined by employing a multi-objective constrained genetic algorithm and the subsequent selection of the optimal solution is carried out by means of the multi-criteria decision-making procedure Electre. This procedure allows the decision maker to express his preferences on the basis of the knowledge of candidate solution set. Quantitative (handling cost) and qualitative (adjacency and distance requests between departments) objectives are considered referring to a bay structure-based layout model, that allows to take into account also practical constraints such as the aspect ratio of departments. Results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed procedure as a practicable support tool for layout designers. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Selection of a robot for a specific industrial application is one of the most challenging problems in real time manufacturing environment. It has become more and more complicated due to increase in complexity, advanced features and facilities that are continuously being incorporated into the robots by different manufacturers. At present, different types of industrial robots with diverse capabilities, features, facilities and specifications are available in the market. Manufacturing environment, product design, production system and cost involved are some of the most influencing factors that directly affect the robot selection decision. The decision maker needs to identify and select the best suited robot in order to achieve the desired output with minimum cost and specific application ability. This paper attempts to solve the robot selection problem using two most appropriate multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and compares their relative performance for a given industrial application. The first MCDM approach is 'VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje' (VIKOR), a compromise ranking method and the other one is 'ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality' (ELECTRE), an outranking method. Two real time examples are cited in order to demonstrate and validate the applicability and potentiality of both these MCDM methods. It is observed that the relative rankings of the alternative robots as obtained using these two MCDM methods match quite well with those as derived by the past researchers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In real life, it is not always the case that experts are able to assess alternatives by precise values. With the incomplete and vague information obtained, the experts are inclined to provide their assessments by eliciting linguistic terms. Considering that the experts may hesitate between several linguistic terms during the evaluating process, a new tool called the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) was introduced to represent this situation. This tool allows the experts to use several possible linguistic terms rather than a single one to appraise the performances of alternatives. In this paper, we investigate the ELECTRE II method in the HFLTS environment and propose two new approaches named the score-deviation-based ELECTRE II method and the positive and negative ideal hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements based ELECTRE II method. To fully explore the underlying preference information and specify the outranking degrees of alternatives, we set up three levels of concordance and discordance sets, which are finally devoted to ranking the alternatives more convincingly. An illustrative example is operated to show the practicability of the proposed methods and then a sensitivity analysis is performed as well to test the robustness of the two methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

If two or more decision-makers assign an equivalent value, that value is only counted once. However, situations in which the same value is repeatedly assigned substantially differ from those in which the value appears only once. Therefore, multi-hesitant fuzzy sets (MHFSs) can be used to manage cases in which values are repeated in a single HFS. In this paper, a method for comparing multi-hesitant fuzzy numbers (MHFNs) is presented. Some outranking relations for MHFNs, which are based on traditional ELECTRE methods, are introduced, and several properties are analyzed. For ranking alternatives, we propose an outranking approach to multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems similar to ELECTRE III, where weights and data are in the form of MHFNs. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the developed approach, and its validity and feasibility are demonstrated by a comparison analysis with other existing methods. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Every planning activity generally requires to make some choices. After a preliminary analysis of the sector under examination, a forecast of trends of input - output items, the planner must define an action plan voted to arrange all the strategies and specific interventions able to fit demand and supply during the planned time. The redaction of an action plan implies a strong effort in order to synthesize either suggestions coming from the analysis phases either all the constraints linked to technical choices. In the same time, a large number of "external" variables plays a role in orienting decision making. Some of these can be handled by numerical models (economic cost-benefit analyses, market penetration strategies, environmental impacts). Other aspects, concerning social and cultural impact, political drawbacks, aesthetic aspects, etc., can be analysed only in a qualitative way, or are subjected to a not-objective judgement. This paper aims of introducing a methodological tool able to "organize" and "synthesize" the large set of variables coming from several specific judgements (or assessments) helping the "decision maker" to read the complex problem, understand it and make choices. Previous works of the authors have presented possible applications of "multicriteria-analysis". In particular, the ELECTRE methods family, (Roy, B., Méthodologie multicritère d'aide à la décision, Economica, coll. "Gestion", Paris, 1985) will be presented under the point of view of energy planning application. It consists in a "flexible" ranking method which takes into account the uncertainties of all the specific assessments, the qualitative nature of some indexes, the weight of the preferences or willingness systems of the decision maker. On the other hand, similar results can be obtained through the application of fuzzy sets theory (Zimmermann, H. J., Fuzzy set Theory and its Application. Kluver Academic Publisher, 1987). A decision making support method, based on fuzzy logic is here tested and compared to the previous one. A case study developed by authors will show differences among these two different approachs. It is focused on the development of a renewable energy diffusion strategies plan. Advantages and drawbacks of both methods will be explored and some suggestions will be proposed. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents Electre Tri-nC, a new sorting method which takes into account several reference actions for characterizing each category. This new method gives a particular freedom to the decision maker in the co-construction decision aiding process with the analyst to characterize the set of categories, while there is no constraint for introducing only one reference action as typical of each category like in Electre Tri-C (Almeida-Dias et al.; 2010). As in such a sorting method, this new sorting method is composed of two joint rules. Electre Tri-nC also fulfills a certain number of natural requirements. Additional results on the behavior of the new method are also provided in this paper, namely the ones with respect to the addition or removal of the reference actions used for characterizing a certain category. A numerical example illustrates the manner in which Electre Tri-nC can be used by a decision maker. A comparison with some related sorting procedures is presented and it allows to conclude that the new method is appropriate to deal with sorting problems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The challenge in Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) design is to find the best combination of design strategies that will face the energy performance problems of a particular building. This paper presents a methodology for the simulation-based multi-criteria optimization of NZEBs. Its main features include four steps: building simulation, optimization process, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and testing solution's robustness. The methodology is applied to investigate the cost-effectiveness potential for optimizing the design of NZEBs in different case studies taken as diverse climatic zones in Lebanon and France. The investigated design parameters include: external walls and roof insulation thickness, windows glazing type, cooling and heating set points, and window to wall ratio. Furthermore, the inspected RE systems include: solar domestic hot water (SDHW) and photovoltaic (PV) array. The proposed methodology is a useful tool to enhance NZEBs design and to facilitate decision making in early phases of building design. Specifically, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is chosen in order to minimize thermal, electrical demands and life cycle cost (LCC) while reaching the net zero energy balance; thus getting the Pareto-front. A ranking decision making technique Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE III) is applied to the Pareto-front so as to obtain one optimal solution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

To obtain the weights of the criteria which influence the proposed problem, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) will be employed. Then, the suitable locations will be evaluated and classified using two different multi-criteria decision methods, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), in this case the version TRI.

abstract={Any decision process deals with two different concerns as its cornerstones, evaluating the alternatives and ranking them based on their performances. In any decision process, the former phase is usually the premise of the latter one. Alternatives' evaluation is the concept that largely depends on the experts and their expertise, which increase uncertainty in the decision-making process. In addition to all proposed methods for having the experts' knowledge as evaluations of the alternatives, utilizing expert decision support systems (EDSS) can be a sensible response to such a need. Having evaluated the alternatives in the first phase of a decision-making process, the second phase of the process deals with the ranking the alternatives based on their performances obtained from the first phase. In this paper, we discuss the architecture of a fuzzy system including both modules, utilizing fuzzy concept for dealing with the uncertainty of the problem. Concerning the problem we had been dealt with, our system comprises a fuzzy evaluation module, which is a fuzzy expert system and an appropriate tool for evaluating the existing alternatives promptly and smoothly, without the imposed time delays by the experts to propose their comments and the uncertainty of such expertise-based comments, and a fuzzy ranking module, which is a fuzzy version of ELECTRE III method ranking the alternatives based on their outranking relations and by considering the existing uncertainty in their performances. This way the final ranking is resulted from an independent fuzzy system, which has considered the existing uncertainty in the evaluations not once but twice. Our proposed system has been applied to a real case of vendor selection process in one of the greatest and the most famous companies in the Iranian oil industry, OIEC, and the results are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Contribution of service supply chains to economic growth is significant and recent climate change issues expect services to be greener. The entire supply chain will be green if their suppliers adopt the requirements of the focal company and customers. Hence, it is essential that every organization constantly analyses and monitors the green performance of different members of the supply chains. Furthermore comprehensive studies have been carried out to identify criteria to evaluate green performance of manufacturing supply chain. However there is lack of studies to identify criteria and evaluate the performance of service supply chain. Service supply chain green performance evaluation necessitates methods to consider both qualitative and quantitative factors. Many conventional multi- criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have drawbacks such as inability to capture realistic fuzziness in decision making (human judgment), inadaptability to different levels of measurement, complexity in calculation and requirement of intricate details, which render them unsuitable for the task of environmental performance evaluation of service supply chains. In this paper, a grey based hybrid framework for evaluating the environmental performance of service supply chains is proposed by integrating grey based method with ELECTRE and VIKOR approaches. Two case studies were carried out to understand the effectiveness of criteria and method to evaluate environmental performance of service supply chains in a developing country context. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recent increases in life loss, destruction and property damages caused by flood at global scale, have inevitably highlighted the pivotal considerations of sustainable development through flood risk management. Throughout the paper, a practical framework to prioritize the flood risk management alternatives for Gorganrood River in Iran was applied. Comparison between multi criteria decision making (MCDM) models with different computational mechanisms provided an opportunity to obtain the most conclusive model. Non-parametric stochastic tests, aggregation models and sensitivity analysis were employed to investigate the most suitable ranking model for the case study. The outcomes of these mentioned tools illustrated that ELimination and Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE III), a non-compensatory model, stood superior to the others. Moreover, Eigen-vector’s performance for assigning weights to the criteria was proved by the application of Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient Test. From the technical point of view, the highest priority among the criteria belonged to a social criteria named Expected Average Number of Casualties per year. Furthermore, an alternative with pre and post disaster effectiveness was determined as the top-rank measure. This alternative constituted flood insurance plus flood warning system. The present research illustrated that ELECTRE III could deal with the complexity of flood management criteria. Hence, this MCDM model would be an effective tool for dealing with complex prioritization issues. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The edge node selection problem in edge computing is a typical multi-criteria group decision-making problem. In this paper, we put forward an ELECTRE II method with the probabilistic linguistic information to handle the edge node selection problem. First, a novel distance measure is developed for probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) and an entropy measure is devised to measure the uncertainty degree of PLTSs. Based on the score value and entropy, a novel method is put forward to compare two PLTSs. Next, a weight-determining method for criteria based on multiple correlation coefficient and a weight-determining method for experts based on entropy theory are proposed. After that, a novel probabilistic linguistic ELECTRE II method is put forward to deal with the edge node selection problem. Comparison with previous methods is provided to verify the superiority of our method. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Many multiple criteria decision making methods have been proposed and applied to water planning. Their purpose is to provide information on tradeoffs among objectives and to help users articulate value judgments in a systematic, coherent, and documentable manner. The wide variety of available techniques confuses potential users, causing inappropriate matching of methods with problems. Experiments in which water planners apply more than one multicriteria procedure to realistic problems can help dispel this confusion by testing method appropriateness, ease of use, and validity. We summarize one such experiment where U.S. Army Corps of Engineers personnel used several methods to screen urban water supply plans. The methods evaluated include goal programming, ELECTRE I, additive value functions, multiplicative utility functions, and three techniques for choosing weights (direct rating, indifference tradeoff, and the analytical hierarchy process). Among the conclusions we reach are the following. First, experienced planners generally prefer simpler, more transparent methods. Additive value functions are favored. Yet none of the methods are endorsed by a majority of the participants; many preferred to use no formal method at all. Second, there is strong evidence that rating, the most commonly applied weight selection method, is likely to lead to weights that fail to represent the trade‐offs that users are willing to make among criteria. Finally, we show that decisions can be as or more sensitive to the method used as to which person applies it. Therefore, if who chooses is important, then so too is how a choice is made.

The proposed method: (a) takes into consideration judgments provided by multiple decision makers (DMs); (b) is based on a structured but yet flexible framework; (c) considers quantitative objective data and qualitative subjective judgments; (d) captures the ambiguity and impreciseness in DMs' judgments, and (e) results in a final priority ranking which is not vague.

This choice of waste management strategy takes into consideration the sustainable development objectives, i.e. economic aspects, environmental consequences, and social issues. Nine alternatives for demolition waste management were compared with the aid of eight criteria, taking into account energy consumption, depletion of abiotic resources, global warming, dispersion of dangerous substances in the environment, economic activity, employment, and quality of life of the local population. The case study concerned the demolition of 25 buildings of an old military camp. Each alternative was illustrated with different waste treatments, such as material recovery, recycling, landfilling, and energy recovery. The recommended solution for sustainable demolition waste management for the case study is a selective deconstruction of each building with local material recovery in road engineering of inert wastes, local energy recovery of wood wastes, and specific treatments for hazardous wastes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The decisions taken in rehabilitation planning for the urban water networks will have a long lasting impact on the functionality and quality of future services provided by urban infrastructure. These decisions can be assisted by different approaches ranging from linear depreciation for estimating the economic value of the network over using a deterioration model to assess the probability of failure or the technical service life to sophisticated multi-criteria decision support systems. Subsequently, the aim of this paper is to compare five available multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods (ELECTRE, AHP, WSM, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE) for the application in an integrated rehabilitation management scheme for a real world case study and analyze them with respect to their suitability to be used in integrated asset management of water systems. The results of the different methods are not equal. This occurs because the chosen score scales, weights and the resulting distributions of the scores within the criteria do not have the same impact on all the methods. Independently of the method used, the decision maker must be familiar with its strengths but also weaknesses. Therefore, in some cases, it would be rational to use one of the simplest methods. However, to check for consistency and increase the reliability of the results, the application of several methods is encouraged. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are introduced to express the hesitance existing in linguistic evaluation as clearly as possible. However, most existing methods using HFLTSs simply rely on the labels or intervals of linguistic terms, which may lead to information distortion and/or loss. To avoid this problem, linguistic scale functions are employed in this paper to conduct the transformation between qualitative information and quantitative data. Moreover, the directional Hausdorff distance, which uses HFLTSs, is also proposed and the dominance relations are subsequently defined using this distance. An outranking approach, similar to the ELECTRE method, is constructed for ranking alternatives in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, and the approach is demonstrated using a numerical example related to supply chain management. Because of the inherent features of the directional Hausdorff distance and the defined dominance relations, this approach can effectively and efficiently overcome the hidden drawbacks that may hamper the use of HFLTSs. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach is further tested through sensitivity and comparative analyses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Environmentally sound end-of-life management of Electrical and Electronic Equipment has been realised as a top priority issue internationally, both due to the waste stream's continuously increasing quantities, as well as its content in valuable and also hazardous materials. In an effort to manage Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), adequate infrastructure in treatment and recycling facilities is considered a prerequisite. A critical number of such plants are mandatory to be installed in order: (i) to accommodate legislative needs, (ii) decrease transportation cost, and (iii) expand reverse logistics network and cover more areas. However, WEEE recycling infrastructures require high expenditures and therefore the decision maker need to be most precautious. In this context, special care should be given on the viability of infrastructure which is heavily dependent on facilities' location. To this end, a methodology aiming towards optimal location of Units of Treatment and Recycling is developed, taking into consideration economical together with social criteria, in an effort to interlace local acceptance and financial viability. For the decision support system's needs, ELECTRE III is adopted as a multicriteria analysis technique.

abstract={The main goal of the AFFOREST project (EU 5th Framework Programme for Research & Technological Development) is the development of a spatial decision support system (SDSS) capable of providing advice for policy and planning decisions pertaining to afforestation of agricultural land. The system addresses questions on 'where,' 'how,' and 'how long' to afforest, based on changes in environmental performance (EP) of the land. EP is defined as the combination of three environmental impact categories: total carbon sequestration (i.e. carbon sequestration in the soil and in biomass), nitrate leaching, and groundwater recharge. The core of the SDSS is a spatial database, storing the location of agricultural land, its environmental performance before, and up to 100 years after, afforestation. EP values, as both a function of time and afforestation strategy, are obtained via a metamodel that uses site characteristics as inputs. Using standard geographical information system (GIS)-software and query tools, the spatial database can be queried to provide answers to questions expressed in terms of thresholds, possibly combined by Boolean operators. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are, however, required to search for locations, afforestation strategies, or time lags. In this paper, we compare three common numerical techniques to help decision makers choose among the afforestation strategies for a given class of agricultural land. We find that all three methods succeed in providing answers to the 'how' question. However, PROMETHEE II is slightly preferable to both ELECTRE III and AHP in AFFOREST, based on user friendliness, simplicity of the model strategy, variation of the solution, and implementation. To test the robustness of the selected methods, the results are compared with a goal programming technique. A general finding for all three MCDM methods is that standard GIS-software packages and their programming facilities are not well suited for a full integration of MCDM-routines. Therefore, a loose coupling with the GIS-environment is required. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The forests in Finland have been under intensive planning for decades. Currently, mathematical programming is widely used in planning of wood production. Today’s multi-functional forestry, however, calls for more flexible decision support methods. MCDM tools have been used in responding to fresh planning challenges. For example, the Finnish Forest and Park Service, entrusted with the care of the vast majority of state-owned natural resources in Finland, endeavours to produce large-scale natural resource plans satisfying the needs of both economic, social, and ecological sustainability. Participatory approach is applied in the process. Several forestry applications of MCDM methods, particularly those making use of the AHP or the HIPRE program, have been presented. Also, the outranking methods ELECTRE and PROMETHEE have been tested. Due to the nature of forestry applications, statistical techniques for analysing uncertainties in pairwise comparisons and for utilizing interval judgement data have been developed to improve the usability of the AHP. Recently, a hybrid method called A’WOT, making use of the AHP and SWOT, was also introduced into strategic forest planning. This paper summarizes the experiences gained in applying a MAVT and two outranking methods in connection with a participatory natural resource planning process in Finland. In addition, some results of the method development work related to application needs are briefly presented. The details of the planning cases reviewed here have previously been presented in forestry journals. The purpose of this paper is not only to show how MCDM methods have been applied in forestry, but also to discuss the usability and usefulness of MCDM methods from the viewpoint of supporting forestry decision making-and how they might further be improved. Also, some perspectives for the future development work of MCDM applications in the field of natural resource management are focused on. As a conclusion, the use of more than just one MCDM method in a single planning process is seen usually recommendable. In addition, developing hybrid MCDM methods is regarded as a potential direction for future research. Also, closer co-operation between method developers and appliers is called for to produce more useful applications. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={ELECTRE is a family of multi-criteria decision analysis techniques which has the ability to provide as much as possible precise and suitable set of actions or alternatives to the underlying problem by eliminating the alternatives which are outranked by others. Group decision making is an effective process to provide the most appropriate solution to real-world decision-making scenarios by considering and merging the expert opinions of multiple individuals on problem. The purpose of this research study is to extend the ELECTRE I method to Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE I (PF-ELECTRE I) method in group decision-making environment, as Pythagorean fuzzy set model is more superior tool to capture vagueness and incompleteness in human evaluations. The developed method has ability to solve multi-criteria group decision-making problems in which the assessment information on available alternatives, provided by the experts, is presented as Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrices having each entry characterized by Pythagorean fuzzy number (PFN). The approach is formulated by introducing the concepts of strong, midrange and weak Pythagorean fuzzy concordance and discordance sets to elaborate the outranking relation among alternatives with respect to conflicting criteria. Framework of group decision supporting system based on PF-ELECTRE I is demonstrated by a flowchart. Finally, two illustrative examples in the field of health safety and environment management are given to verify and demonstrate the applicability of our proposed approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose To develop a multi–attribute decision making model for evaluating and selecting among logistic information technologies. Design/methodology/approach First a multi–attribute decision making model for logistic information technology evaluation and selection consisting of 4 main and 11 sub criteria is constructed, then a hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS method is developed to solve the complex selection problem with vague and linguistic data. Sensitivity analysis is presented. Findings Reviews the literature and provides a structured hierarchical model for logistic information technology evaluation and selection based on the premise that the logistic information technology evaluation and selection problem can be viewed as a product of tangible benefits, intangible benefits, policy issues and resources. Defines tangible benefits as cost savings, increased revenue, and return on investment; intangible benefits as customer satisfaction, quality of information, multiple uses of information, and setting tone for future business; policy issues as risk and necessity level; resources as costs and completion time. Presents a methodology that is developed for the complex, uncertain and vague characteristics of the problem. Research limitations/implications Comparisons with other multi–attribute decision making techniques such as AHP, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE and ORESTE under fuzzy conditions can be done for further research. Practical implications This article is a very useful source of information both for logistic managers and stakeholders in making decisions about logistic information technology investments.

First, the framework of the indicator system is obtained from the literature review and refined according to the resources evaluation standards and different perspectives of the various scholars. Then this paper selects seven wind/solar hybrid power stations which have been put into operation as the case study, weights the indicators through the method of order relations, and evaluates these seven regions via ELECTRE-II. The conclusions are consistent with the related research findings and have better correctness, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.

The comparison of these renewable energy conversion plants is based on two complementary analyses. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was conducted to provide measures of radial efficiency relative to the observed frontier of production possibilities. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), using the IRIS/ELECTRE TRI methodology, was conducted to obtain a different perspective on the results, and as a tool that would enable to incorporate managerial preferences easily. To be able to use IRIS while keeping the spirit behind DEA, the evaluation criteria were defined as different output/input efficiency ratios, and no information about criteria weights was introduced at the outset. The results suggest that MCDA, and the use of IRIS in particular, constitutes a useful approach that can be applied in a complementary way to DEA. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In ELECTRE methods, the construction of an outranking relation amounts at validating or invalidating, for any pair of alternatives (a,b), the assertion "a is at least as good as b". This comparison is grounded on the evaluation vectors of both alternatives, and on additional information concerning the decision maker's preferences, accounting for two conditions: concordance and non-discordance. In decision processes using these methods, the analyst should interact with the decision maker in order to elicit values for preferential parameters. This can be done either directly or through a disaggregation procedure that infers the parameters values from holistic judgements provided by the decision maker. Inference is usually performed through an optimization program that accounts for the aggregation model and minimizes an "error function". Although disaggregation approaches have been largely used in additive models, only few advances have been made towards a disaggregation approach for outranking methods. Indeed, outranking methods may lead to computationally difficult inference problems. In this paper we are concerned with a slight adaptation of the valued outranking relation used in the ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI. Such modification is shown to preserve the original discordance concept. We show that the modified outranking relation makes it easier to solve inference programs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Construction industry is the most significant fields on a global scale, with respect to its economic, technological, and environmental impact. Its rapid growth over the last decades has resulted in an enormous increase of the produced construction and demolition waste, thus provoking a considerable burden on the environment. The proposed methodological framework is aiming towards optimal location of units of alternative construction and demolition waste management and it is following the path of multicriteria analysis. For the problem under study, ELECTRE III technique is adopted. The decision process presented requires the adoption of a number of logical steps mainly, clarification of the decision criteria for selecting the optimal location (economical, environmental and social), the definition of their relative significance and data assembly. The approach allows a robust parameter analysis in order to evaluate and compare in detail all available alternatives. On top of that, sensitivity analysis is also available, since parameter values in real life applications originate from estimations which are sometimes more or less reliable. This paper presents an effort to interlace local acceptance, financial viability and level of environmental quality which represents a vital issue for the particular waste stream's management efficiency. The methodology is implemented and demonstrated for the case of the Region of Central Macedonia, Greece and can be employed either by private investors or public authorities in other areas internationally. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), which allows people to give their qualitative preferences in linguistic terms with corresponding probabilities, is a powerful form to express people's preferences. This paper proposes a new ELECTRE III method to address multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems based on novel operations of PLTSs. The new operations, including the addition, subtraction, and division of PLTSs are developed by considering the disparity degrees of linguistic terms. Then, novel concepts named the standard vector and gap function of PLTSs are introduced to represent the errors caused by the cognition differences of assessors. After transforming cost and target-based criteria to beneficial criteria, we define the concordance index, discordance index and outstanding degrees in PLTSs. The distillation process and Borda rule are used to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. After giving the algorithm of the probabilistic linguistic ELECTRE III (PL-ELECTRE III) method, we implement it to solve a problem concerning the nurse–patient relationship with the modified Okatani Keyco nurse–patient relationship trust scale.

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, such as ELECTRE, PROMETEE, AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, have been applied to solving numerous real-life decision making problems in business and management. However, the mechanics of those methods is not easily understandable and it is often seen by users without much formal training as a kind of "scientific witchcraft". In order to make those popular MCDA methods more transparent, we provide a simple framework for interpretations of rankings they produce. The framework builds on the classical results of MCDA, in particular on the preference capture mechanism proposed by Zionts and Wallenius in seventies of the last century, based on Simple Additive Weighting. The essence and the potential impact of our contribution is that given a ranking produced by an MCDA method, we show how to derive weights for the Simple Additive Weighting which yield the same ranking as the given method. In that way we establish a common framework for almost no-cost posterior analysis, interpretation and comparison of rankings produced by MCDA methods in the expert systems environment. We show the working of the concept taking the TOPSIS method in focus, but it applies in the same way to any other MCDM method. We illustrate our reasoning with numerical examples taken from literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face many obstacles when they try to access the credit market. These obstacles increase if the SMEs are innovative. In this case, financial data are insufficient or even unreliable. Thus, building a judgmental rating model, mainly based on qualitative criteria (soft information), is very important to finance SMEs' activities. Till now, there has not been a multicriteria credit risk model based on soft information for innovative SMEs. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by presenting a multicriteria credit risk model named ELECTRE-TRI. A SMAA-TRI analysis is also implemented to obtain robust SMEs' assignments to the risk classes. SMAA-TRI incorporates ELECTRE-TRI by considering different sets of preference parameters and uncertainty in the data via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we carry out a real case study with the aim of illustrating the multicriteria credit risk model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Reservoir operation rules are logical or mathematical equations that take into account system variables to calculate water release from a reservoir based on inflow and storage volume values. In fact, previous experiences of the system are used to balance reservoir system parameters in each operational period. Commonly, reservoir operation rules have been considered to be linear decision rules (LDRs) and constant coefficients developed by using various optimization procedures. This paper addresses the application of real-time operation rules on a reservoir system whose purpose is to supply total downstream demand. Those rules include standard operation policy (SOP), stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), LDR, and nonlinear decision rule (NLDR) with various orders of inflow and reservoir storage volume. Also, a multi-attribute decision method, elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE)-I, with a combination of indices, objective functions, and reservoir performance criteria (reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability) are used to rank the aforementioned rules. The ranking method employs two combinations of indices: (1) performance criteria and (2) objective function and performance criteria by using the same weights for all criteria. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014},

In a framework where DMs provide constraints bounding and interrelating the parameter values, rather than fixing precise figures, we discuss the problem of finding the best and worst category that each action may attain.},

abstract={This study proposes a new group decision making (GDM) methodology to solve outranking problems efficiently under uncertainty integrating multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. To this aim, ELECTRE I, an outranking based MCDM approach is extended with VIKOR method, an ideal solution based approach, under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The methodology utilizes pairwise comparison and outranking relation concepts of ELECTRE methods to construct different concordance and discordance sets in order to reflect preferences of decision makers effectively. By the help of similarities between concordance and discordance characteristics of ELECTRE and maximum group utility and minimum individual regret characteristics of VIKOR, the methodology enables the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE to overcome its weakness in ranking process and presents complete ranking. In addition, this study employs entropy method to identify the weights of criteria and decision makers, and weighted distance approach to determine the weights of different concordance sets. Utilizing these methods leads to specifying these weights objectively. The applicability of the proposed approach is explored by an illustrative example on supplier selection problem by explaining the method step by step. Furthermore, four computational experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate its applicability to the other areas and the results are compared. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a reliability analysis technique that plays a prominent role in improving the reliability and safety of systems, products, and/or services. Although commonly used in quality improvement efforts, the conventional Risk Priority Number (RPN) method has been heavily criticized in the literature for its various limitations, such as in failure mode evaluations, risk factor weights, and RPN computation. In this article, we describe the application of an ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité)-based outranking approach for FMEA within the interval two-tuple linguistic environment. Considering different types of FMEA team members' assessment information, we employ a hybrid averaging operator to construct the group assessment matrix and use a modified ELECTRE method to analyze the group interval two-tuple linguistic data. Furthermore, the new risk-ranking model deals with the subjective and objective weights of risk factors concurrently, considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the risk analysis. The practicality and applicability of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to a risk evaluation problem of proton beam radiotherapy, and a comparative study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the new FMEA approach.

The methodological scheme is based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for prioritizing available options applicable to a defined tourism area. The proposed framework is implemented for Greece, one of the world's most popular tourism destinations, and optimally ranks 18 mitigation and 16 adaptation measures under 4 criteria i.e. environmental benefit, applicability, cost and social acceptance. The analysis indicates that rational energy use, improvement of energy efficiency and water management/saving measures should be primarily put forward for the Greek case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

In real-world decision-aiding situations, it is reasonable to consider only the interaction between a small number of criterion pairs. Three types of interaction have been considered: mutual strengthening, mutual weakening, and antagonistic. The new concordance index correctly takes into account such types of interactions, by imposing such conditions as boundary, monotonicity, and continuity. We demonstrate that the generalized index is able to take the three types of interaction, or dependencies, between criteria into account satisfactorily, first using quasi-criteria and then using pseudo-criteria. We also examine the links between the new concordance index and the Choquet integral. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Locating an incinerator and a facility to store ashes and other wastes is a long and complex process in Italy. The District of Turin faced this situation by choosing a participative approach to the problem and by using multi-criteria (MC) analysis as a support for a specific phase of this decision process. A group of 45 decision-makers (local authorities and representatives from the different communities that were involved) worked together with a facilitator group for 16 months to identify the criteria judged relevant to analyse the consequences of the location of a plant. Two MC models - one for the incinerator and the other for the waste-disposal plant - were elaborated and an ELECTRE method used to compare sites and rank them with the aim of selecting the best sites to activate an Environmental Impact Assessment procedure. A team made up of analysts from different organisations supported this work from a technical point of view. This paper proposes an analysis of this participatory decision process and synthesises the difficulties and results of the MC decision aid intervention. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of comparison of energy alternatives from the social and public health point of view. First the conditions required for an accurate comparison are outlined. Then a large multi-criteria model is carried out in order to provide the framework for comparison of six energy chains: oil, coal, nuclear, solar thermal Themis, solar thermal Thek and solar photovoltaïc specified in the French conditions. The method used is the ELECTRE type and is therefore based on an analysis of the concordance and discordance of criteria. It also allows us to take into account uncertainty, since modelling of preferences is done by fuzzy outranking relations. We then developed four energy strategies based on realistic hypotheses, which allowed us to take into consideration the points of view of the various social groups involved in this problem of energy choices. The results we arrived at coincide with what are known to be the stands of these groups. This makes the method a particularly useful tool, not only to help justify a choice, but above all as a decision-aid. © 1983.},

abstract={Energy is one of the main factors that must be considered in the discussions of sustainable development. The basic dimensions of sustainability of energy production are environmentally, technically, economically and socially sustainable supply of energy resources that, in the long term, is reliable, adequate and affordable. Renewable, clean and cost effective energy sources are preferred but unfortunately no one of the alternative energy sources can meet these demands solely. So, the problem of determining the sustainable energy planning is a strategic tool for the development. In this dissertation, the aim of this study is to determine the best renewable energy technology for sustainable energy planning. For this aim, we used AHP methodology, which is a multi-criteria decision making (MDCM) method. In the proposed method, the weights of the selection criteria are determined by pairwise comparison matrices of the AHP. Results indicate that wind energy is the most appropriate renewable energy option in this study. Future researches could be conducted based on different multi-criteria decision-making techniques such as ANP, fuzzy ELECTRE or fuzzy TOPSIS for comparative purposes.},

abstract={“No technology, no finance” has been the consensus in banking industry. Under the background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. The technology company selection can be regarded as a kind of multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a useful tool to express decision makers’ (DMs’) evaluations in the technology company selection. This paper develops a new method for MAGDM with PLTSs. Firstly, the possibility degree and range value of PLTSs are defined. Then a possibility degree algorithm is designed for ranking PLTSs. An Euclidean distance measure between PLTSs is presented and extended to probabilistic linguistic matrices. Based on Archimedean t-norm and s-norm, some new operational laws for PLTSs are defined and some desirable properties are discussed. Then, a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher weighted averaging (GPLHWA) operator and a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher ordered weighted averaging (GPLHOWA) operator are developed. Some useful properties for these operators are investigated in detail. Combined with the subjective weights of DMs, the DMs’ weights are determined by the adjusted coefficients. Using the GPLHWA operator, the collective decision matrix is obtained by aggregating all the individual decision matrices. By maximizing the total weighted square possibility degree, a multi-objective program is constructed to derive the attribute weights. The ranking order of alternatives is generated by integrating ELECTRE and TOPSIS. Thereby, a new method is put forward for MAGDM with PLTSs. A Fintech example is analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The sensitivity analysis and comparative analyses are conducted to illustrate its advantages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={As conventional energy resources are limited and polluting, new energy resources, being renewable and environmentally friendly, have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, no study on new energy investment, which acts a significant role in promoting the development and use of new energy resources, has been conducted. To cover this gap, an applicable decision support model is established by integrating Z-numbers, regret theory and elimination and choice translating reality III (ELECTRE III) to address new energy investment risk evaluation problems. In this way, Z-numbers are used to describe the decision-making information involved in the problems, a suggested method is combined with regret theory to determine the utility, rejoice and regret values of Z-information, and ELECTRE III is introduced to handle multiple criteria evaluation comprehensively. To elucidate and validate the application of the established model, a case study for new energy investment in Qingshuitang Industrial Zone is conducted and in-depth results analysis and discussion are implemented. The study shows that solar energy is the best investment project and environment is the most important investment factor. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the established model can effectively support new energy investment decision-making and it performs better than other existing methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The offshore/onsite teams’ knowledge transfer (KT) effectiveness is one of the key determinants for achieving the outcome of global software development (GSD) projects. In this study, the significance of offshore/onsite teams (GSD teams) KT effectiveness in GSD projects is measured through various factors: knowledge, team, technology, and organization factors. Moreover, the assessment framework for the integration of knowledge, team, technology, and organization factors for evaluating KT effectiveness in GSD projects has not been adequately available in the existing literature. For this motivation, the main objective of this study is to propose the assessment framework to evaluate offshore/onsite teams KT effectiveness with reference to GSD project outcome. For evaluating KT effectiveness of GSD teams, we have integrated three Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) methodologies: (a) Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), (b) Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and (c) Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REaite (ELECTRE). Further, the hybridization of fuzzy DEMATEL, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE has not available in the existing literature. Based on this research gap, we have integrated fuzzy DEMATEL, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE approach for evaluating KT effectiveness of offshore/onsite teams in the context of GSD project outcome. Subsequently, the applicability and capability of proposed framework has been validated by software experts at Inowits Software Organization in India. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Outsourcing has become a common and important link for enterprises. When selecting an outsourcing provider, single-valued neutrosophic linguistic sets can successfully express qualitative and fuzzy information. Furthermore, the selection of an outsourcing provider is a multi-criteria decision-making problem that can be tackled by the multi-attribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method. In MABAC, criteria are assumed to be compensatory. However, criteria may be non-compensatory in outsourcing provider selection. Thus, this paper introduces the main idea of the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method. An MABAC–ELECTRE method is established under single-valued neutrosophic linguistic environments. This method uses the mean-squared deviation weight method to obtain the weights of criteria. Moreover, an illustrative example is conducted to explain the procedure of the MABAC–ELECTRE method. A comparative analysis verifies its feasibility in solving problems with non-compensatory criteria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Transport is an economic activity having complex interactions with the environment, and since the concept of sustainable development was identified as a global priority, there has been a growing interest in assessing the performance of transport systems with respect to sustainability issues. Although the Ecological Economics literature deals extensively with the strategy of sustainable development, far less attention has been paid to its application in the transport sector as of yet. The main purpose of this study was to introduce the noncompensatory analytical tool, which integrates multidimensional conditions present in the sustainability concept. The focus was on the potential of the outranking approach, namely the ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité; Elimination And Choice Corresponding to Reality) method for the evaluation of transport sustainability at the macro level, using the indicator set as a starting point. The method has been applied to selected European countries within a case study. As a result, according to transport-sustainability issues, pairwise relations between countries have been established. Based on these relations, and according to the chosen criteria, a set of countries with a better level of performance was selected as the core subset of the relation graph. To control and avoid the appearance of indifference relations between countries, as well as to reduce the subjectivity of decision makers, we propose a modification of ELECTRE I. Finally, we apply both the original and the modified methods, together with the sensitivity analysis. The results are presented in a convenient graph form and then compared. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is an engineering technique aimed at the detection of potential failures, their causes and consequences on the system/process under investigation. When used for the failure modes prioritization, FMEA is also referred to as Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). In traditional FMECA, risk priorities of failure modes are determined through the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a function of the three risk parameters Occurrence (O), Severity (S), and Detection (D). In the present paper, an alternative approach to the RPN is proposed for the criticality assessment of process/system failure modes. Particularly, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method ELECTRE TRI is employed to assign failure modes to predefined and ordered risk classes, from the highest to the lowest risky one. Contrarily to the traditional RPN, the method allows the Decision Maker (DM) at taking into account the relative importance of risk parameters as well as his/her uncertainty in assigning each failure mode to a specific risk class. The ELECTRE TRI-based approach is implemented on the applicative case proposed by Kurt and Özilgen (2013) with reference to Turkish dairy manufacturing industries. A sensitivity analysis is finally performed in order to test the influence of the input parameters on the classification results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We present a new method, called ELECTREGKMS, which employs robust ordinal regression to construct a set of outranking models compatible with preference information. The preference information supplied by the decision maker (DM) is composed of pairwise comparisons stating the truth or falsity of the outranking relation for some real or fictitious reference alternatives. Moreover, the DM specifies some ranges of variation of comparison thresholds on considered pseudo-criteria. Using robust ordinal regression, the method builds a set of values of concordance indices, concordance thresholds, indifference, preference, and veto thresholds, for which all specified pairwise comparisons can be restored. Such sets are called compatible outranking models. Using these models, two outranking relations are defined, necessary and possible. Whether for an ordered pair of alternatives there is necessary or possible outranking depends on the truth of outranking relation for all or at least one compatible model, respectively. Distinguishing the most certain recommendation worked out by the necessary outranking, and a possible recommendation worked out by the possible outranking, ELECTREGKMS answers questions of robustness concern. The method is intended to be used interactively with incremental specification of pairwise comparisons, possibly with decreasing confidence levels. In this way, the necessary and possible outranking relations can be, respectively, enriched or impoverished with the growth of the number of pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, the method is able to identify troublesome pieces of preference information which are responsible for incompatibility. The necessary and possible outranking relations are to be exploited as usual outranking relations to work out recommendation in choice or ranking problems. The introduced approach is illustrated by a didactic example showing how ELECTREGKMS can support real-world decision problems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When considering Electre's valued outranking relations, aggregation/disaggregation methodologies have difficulties in taking discordance (veto) into account. We present a partial inference procedure to compute the value of the veto-related parameters that best restore a set of outranking statements (i.e., examples that an Electre model should restore) provided by a decision maker, given fixed values for the remaining parameters of the model. This paper complements previous work on the inference of other preference-related parameters (weights, cutting level, category limits, ...), advancing toward an integrated framework of inference problems in Electre III and Tri methods. We propose mathematical programs to infer veto-related parameters, first considering only one criterion, then all criteria simultaneously, using the original version of Electre outranking relation and two variants. This paper shows that these inference procedures lead to linear programming, 0-1 linear programming, or separable programming problems, depending on the case. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The main stem of the Santa Cruz River Basin is taken as a case study. The conflicting nature of wateraelated issues necessitates a broader approach to river basin planning than the frequently used single-objective context in which each objective, such as flood protection, ground-water recharges, and water supply, is considered in isolation of the other objectives. In reformulating the problem, a multiobjective approach is taken. Solutions are obtained from four multiobjective techniques briefly described and applicable to the selection among discrete alternatives: ELECTRE, compromise programming, cooperative game theory, and multiattribute utility theory. Review and comparison of these solutions as well as sensitivity analysis on each is provided. The difference between results may be explained by the manner in which the techniques use discordance. All four techniques appear to be robust to moderate parameter changes. © ASCE.},

abstract={The use of renewable energy sources for the production of electric power brings huge benefits both in terms of environmental protection as well as savings in non-renewable resources. Photovoltaic stands out from other renewable energy sources for its simplicity and the modularity of its energy conversion system. To date, the most highly developed technology for the construction of solar cells is one based on mono and polycrystalline silicon. An alternative production line is currently under development to produce, thin-film modules. There are currently a variety of processes and materials available to make thin-film cells but their relative costs and performance differ. Therefore, it would be useful to make a comparative evaluation of the different processes using a multiple criteria method. This paper proposes an application of an outranking methodology to assess a selection of production processes of thin-film solar technology. As this work demonstrates, multi-criteria analysis can provide a technical-scientific decision making support tool that is able to justify its choices clearly and consistently in the renewable energy sector. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first one, the group's members elaborate individually a preorder (total or partial) on the alternatives set. These preorders can be obtained, for example, by applying a multicriterion aggregation procedure such as ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE I or II. In the second step, these individual preorders (total or partial) are aggregated into a collective preorder (total or partial). For this purpose, we first built a distance measure between pairs of binary relations in order to quantify the divergence between two preorders. Then we determine, for each pair of alternatives, the relative importance coefficients of the group's members by using a method based on subjective and objective components. These coefficients and the distance measure are finally exploited by an iterative algorithm in order to elaborate a collective preorder synthesizing the individual preorders.},

abstract={Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), which allows the membership degree of an element to a set represented by several possible values, is considered as a powerful tool to express uncertain information in the process of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. In this paper, we develop a hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE I (HF-ELECTRE I) method and apply it to solve the MCDM problem under hesitant fuzzy environments. The new method is formulated using the concepts of hesitant fuzzy concordance and hesitant fuzzy discordance which are based on the given score function and deviation function, and employed to determine the preferable alternative. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed method, and the influence of different numbers of alternatives on outranking relations is analyzed based on a derived sensitive parameter interval in which a change in the parameters has no effects on the set of the nonoutranked alternatives. The randomly generated numerical cases are also investigated in the framework of the HF-ELECTRE I method. Furthermore, the outranking relations obtained in the HF-ELECTRE I method with those derived from the aggregation operator-based approach and the ELECTRE III and ELECTRE IV methods are discussed. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Those who conduct integrated assessments (IAs) are aware of the need to explicitly consider multiple criteria and uncertainties when evaluating policies for preventing global warming. MCDM methods are potentially useful for understanding tradeoffs and evaluating risks associated with climate policy alternatives. A difficulty facing potential MCDM users is the wide range of different techniques that have been proposed, each with distinct advantages. Methods differ in terms of validity, ease of use, and appropriateness to the problem. Alternative methods also can yield strikingly different rankings of alternatives. A workshop was held in which climate change experts and policy makers evaluated the usefulness of MCDM for IA. Participants applied several methods in the context of a hypothetical greenhouse gas policy decision. Methods compared include value and utility functions, goal programming, ELECTRE, fuzzy sets, stochastic dominance, min max regret, and several weight selection methods. Ranges, rather than point estimates, were provided for some questions to incorporate imprecision regarding weights. Additionally, several visualization methods for both deterministic and uncertain cases were used and evaluated. Analysis of method results and participant feedback through questionnaires and discussion provide the basis for conclusions regarding the use of MCDM methods for climate change policy and IA analyses. Hypotheses are examined concerning predictive and convergent validity of methods, existence of splitting bias among experts, perceived ability of methods to aid decision-making, and whether expressing imprecision can change ranking results. Because participants gained from viewing a problem from several perspectives and results from different methods often significantly differed, it appears worthwhile to apply several MCDM methods to increase user confidence and insight. The participants themselves recommended such multimethod approaches for policymaking.

abstract={Organizations are struggling to leverage emerging opportunities for maintaining sustainability in the global markets due to many barriers in the era of Industry 4.0 and circular economy. The main aim of this study is to analyze these barriers to improve the sustainability of a supply chain. Our study identifies the major criteria for sustainable operations and barriers that need to be overcome to achieve the objectives of sustainability through literature review and experts’ opinions. An integrated approach comprising Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) is used to analyze these barriers and ensure the sustainable supply chain operations. Resource circularity, increasing profits from green products, and designing processes for resource and energy efficiency have been found to be as major sustainability criteria. There are many barriers to the implementation of Industry 4.0. These barriers include but are not limited to, a lack of a skilled workforce that understands Industry 4.0, ineffective legislation and controls, ineffective performance framework, and short-term corporate goals. The study finds that ineffective strategies for the integration of industry 4.0 with sustainability measures, combined with a lack of funds for industry 4.0 initiatives, are just two of the major barriers. The findings of the study will help organizations to develop an effective and integrated strategic approach that will foster sustainable operations through the utilization of improved knowledge of Industry 4.0 and the circular economy. © 2020},

abstract={A great majority of methods designed for Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) assume that all assessment criteria are considered at the same level, however, decision problems encountered in practice often impose a hierarchical structure of criteria. The hierarchy helps to decompose complex decision problems into smaller and manageable subtasks, and thus, it is very attractive for computational efficiency and explanatory purposes. To handle the hierarchy of criteria in MCDA, a methodology called Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP), has been recently proposed. MCHP permits to consider preference relations with respect to a subset of criteria at any level of the hierarchy. Here, we propose to apply MCHP to the ELECTRE III ranking method adapted to handle three types of interaction effects between criteria: mutual-weakening, mutual-strengthening and antagonistic effect. We also involve in MCHP an imprecise elicitation of criteria weights, generalizing a technique called the SRF method. In order to explore the plurality of rankings obtained by the ELECTRE III method for possible sets of criteria weights, we apply the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) that permits to draw robust conclusions in terms of rankings and preference relations at each level of the hierarchy of criteria. The novelty of the whole methodology consists of a joint consideration of hierarchical assessments of alternatives performances on interacting criteria, imprecise criteria weights, and robust analysis of ranking recommendations resulting from ELECTRE III. An example regarding the multiple criteria ranking of some European universities will show how to apply the proposed methodology on a decision problem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, the equilibrium solution and the resolution method for the MADM game have also been developed; these results are validated by a product development example of nano-materials.

abstract={Locational decisions concerning implantation of power stations require to take into consideration several qualitative or quantitative criteria of economic, technological or social nature. The width of the problem involves many actors having divergent opinions on the relative importance of these criteria. Solving a decision problem of this aspect has recourse to multicriteria modelling. In the literature, the multicriteria location models on the graph or those which were developed with multiobjective mathematical programming are inadequate and/or inoperational to deal with the location of power plants. We have found that the electre iii multicriteria decision aid method is well adapted to this problem. In this paper we present a case study carried out by Electricité de France International in a North African country. The problem is to select the best sites in three coastal regions to locate thermal power plants. The problem is formulated, the criteria are estimated and quantified, the selection is achieved by using the electre iii method, and the obtained solutions are discussed. © 1990.},

Because of these abilities, IT2 FNs have been widely applied indecision support systems (DSS). In this paper, to ensure more effective multi-criteria group decision-making in uncertain environments, the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method is extended using interval type-2 fuzzy numbers. An α-based distance method is first proposed to measure the proximity between the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers. Then, an entropy measure for the IT2 FNs and an entropy weight model are developed to objectively determine the criteria weights without any weight information. By applying an α-based distance method, the concordance and discordance for each alternative are measured to determine the partial-preference outranking order. A complementary analysis is then conducted to obtain the full rank order of all alternatives. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are detailed using two different practical examples. A sensitivity and comparative analysis are also conducted to demonstrate the strength and practicality of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent research is recognizing that multicriteria decision making should take into account the concepts of uncertainty, risk, and confidence. In some cases, precise determination of the exact value of the attributes is difficult. Consequently, to surmount this potential problem, their values are considered as fuzzy and intervals. The elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) is one of the most widely used methods to rank a set of alternatives versus a set of criteria to reflect the decision maker's preference. What is customary in almost all recent papers regarding ELECTRE is the utilization of fuzzy concepts in decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic ELECTRE method which assimilates the concepts of interval weights and data for the facilitation of evaluation of a set of alternatives against a set of criteria in this situation. Finally, the executive procedure of our proposed ELECTRE method is illustrated by applying it to the problem of supplier selection. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

As a methodological framework, a two-step questionnaire survey was conducted by 70 firms that have and use concrete pumps. A solution of the problem was then found in the light of the real world data by means of ELECTRE III. The paper can be of value to researchers studying the anatomy of decision-making in equipment selection in general and investigating selection criteria of concrete pumps in particular. It also contributes to the academic environment as an application practice of ELECTRE III to correspond with the nature of equipment selection and as an effective means for the formalization of knowledge possessed by industrial practitioners. On the practical side, ELECTRE III offers an efficient and convenient tool that forces the users into orderly and methodical thinking, and guides them in making logical and robust decisions. In addition, the example illustrated in the present study can be helpful for decision-makers dealing with similar equipment selection issues.},

abstract={Inter-working of existing packet switched wireless access technologies can help make services ubiquitously available. However this means that the services will have to be delivered over a heterogeneous mix of access technologies. There are several technical challenges that have to be overcome in such an environment, with selection of an optimal service delivery network being one of the most important issues. Choosing a nonoptimal network can result in problems such as the use of expensive access types or poor service experience. Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) algorithms have been considered in the past to rank the candidate networks in a preference order. While many types of MADM algorithms exist, the decision maker may choose to use a particular type of algorithm to solve a decision problem based on an assessment of the suitability of the algorithm to the problem space. This paper adapts ELECTRE, a type of MADM algorithm that performs pair-wise comparisons amongst the alternatives, to solve the problem of network selection. The algorithm has been modified so that it is able to provide complete ranking of networks even in scenarios where the utility of some attributes is non-monotonic. The algorithm has been evaluated by applying it to a network selection scenario in a heterogeneous wireless network environment. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, ELECTRE-TRI method has been used for ranking the optimal solutions of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which has been developed for multi-objective operation optimization of a cascade system of reservoirs. In the multi-objective optimization model, flood control and water supply have been considered as short-term and long-term objectives, respectively. The flood control objective function has been formulated to minimize the expected flood damages in different flooding months. A short-term reservoir optimization model which provides the optimal hourly releases during floods has been developed and linked to a flood damage estimation model. The water supply objective function minimizes water deficit damages in agricultural areas. The losses associated with deficit in supplying agricultural water demands have been calculated based on crop yield responses to deficit irrigation. Selection of the most practical solution among the optimal Pareto set of solutions, which is addressed using ELECTRE-TRI method, is a challenging issue. The proposed methodology provides an opportunity for further incorporation of decision makers' preferences in ranking the NSGA-II optimal set of solutions. The results of applying the developed models to the cascade system of the Dez and Bakhtiari Reservoirs in southwest of Iran show that ELECTRE-TRI method has the ability to rank the non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective operation optimization model and provides a suitable framework for considering the preferences of decision makers (DMs). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As a generalization of fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets constrain the membership degree of an element to be a set of possible values between zero and one. Those sets are considered useful in handling decision problems defined under uncertainties where decision-makers hesitate among several values before expressing their preferences. Motivated by the idea of traditional ELECTRE methods, the dominance relations and the opposition relations for hesitant fuzzy sets are introduced in this paper. In addition, several desirable properties are studied. Then, a novel outranking relation is developed, based on systematic comparison of assessments given to alternatives for each criterion. An outranking approach for multi-criteria decision-making problems with hesitant fuzzy sets, similar to ELECTRE III, is proposed for ranking alternatives. Finally, an example is given to verify the developed approach and demonstrate its validity and feasibility. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The necessity to take into account several decision parameters apart from purely economic ones, such as socio-political, technical, institutional and environmental, lead to the use of multi-criteria methods instead of single uni-criterion ones. Moreover, most of the times such decisions are taken in a group environment.

In this paper, extended gray numbers (EGNs), integrated with discrete gray numbers and interval gray numbers are used to express the uncertainty of stochastic MCDM problems. Stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) and ELECTRE III are combined to solve stochastic MCDM problems with uncertain weight information. First, the outranking relations on interval gray numbers and EGNs are defined. Then, a SMAA-ELECTRE model for dealing with gray stochastic MCDM problems is constructed. Finally, an illustrative example and two comparative analyses are provided to verify the feasibility and usability of the proposed approach. The proposed approach provides recommendations for alternatives based on uncertain preference information. It therefore contributes a new way to solve stochastic MCDM problems with uncertain, imprecise, and/or missing preference information. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Pressure from legislation and customers has motivated companies to consider reverse logistics (RL) in their operations. Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The GIS will be shown to be a very useful tool, since GIS are able to generate a database which serves as a starting point for conducting any decision support system. The posed problem will be resolved using restrictions to reduce the area of study, and the criteria that will influence the decision-making. These criteria will be of different natures; with quantitative criteria (numerical values) coexisting with qualitative criteria (labels and linguistic variables). In this article, AHP will be used to obtain the weights of the criteria, and the fuzzy TOPSIS method for the evaluation of the alternatives.

abstract={Climate change vulnerability assessment is a complex form of risk assessment which accounts for both geophysical and socio-economic components of risk. In indicator-based vulnerability assessment (IBVA), indicators are used to rank the vulnerabilities of socio-ecological systems (SESs). The predominant aggregation approach in the literature, sometimes based on multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), typically builds a global-scale, utility function based on weighted summation, to generate rankings. However, the corresponding requirement for additive independence and complete knowledge of system interactions by analyst are rarely if ever satisfied in IBVA. We build an analogy between the structures of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and IBVA problems and show that a set of techniques called Outranking Methods, developed in MCDA to deal with criteria incommensurability, data uncertainty and preference imprecision, offer IBVA a sound alternative to additive or multiplicative aggregation. We reformulate IBVA problems within an outranking framework, define thresholds of difference and use an outranking method, ELECTRE III, to assess the relative vulnerability to heat stress of 15 local government areas in metropolitan Sydney. We find that the ranking outcomes are robust and argue that an outranking approach is better suited for assessments characterized by a mix of qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative indicators, threshold effects and uncertainties about the exact relationships between indicators and vulnerability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on the regional characteristics, literature related to disposal sites and waste management, local expert, data availability and assessments via questionnaires, 15 constraints, and 5 factors were built in the hierarchical structure for landfill suitability by multi-criteria evaluation. The factors are divided into environmental and socio-economic groups. The methodology is used for preliminary assessment of the 20-year most useful lifetime suitable landfilling sites by combining fuzzy set theory, weighted linear combination (WLC) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a GIS environment. The criteria standardization is undertaken by application of different fuzzy membership functions. The fuzzy membership functions shape and their control points are chosen through assessment of expert opinion. The weightings of each selection criterion are assigned depending on the relative importance using the AHP methodology. The WLC approach is applied for alternative landfill sites prioritization. The results of this study showed five potential candidate sites, which are generated when the environmental factors are valued higher than socio-economic factors. These sites are ranked in descending order using the ELECTRE III method. However, the final decision will require further detailed geotechnical and hydrogeological analyses toward the protection of groundwater as well as surface water. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Release planning is known to be a cognitively and computationally difficult problem. Different kinds of uncertainties make it hard to formulate and solve the problem. Our solution approach called EVOLVE+ mitigates these difficulties by (i) an evolutionary problem solving method combining rigorous solution methods to solve the actual formalization of the problem combined with the interactive involvement of the human experts in this process, (ii) provision of a portfolio of diversified and qualified solutions at each iteration of the solution process, and (iii) the application of a multi-criteria decision aid method (ELECTRE IS) to assist the selection of the final solution from a set of qualified solutions. At the final stage of the process, an outranking relation is established among the qualified candidate solutions to address existing soft constraints or objectives. A case study is provided to illustrate and initially evaluate the given approach. The proposed method and results are not limited to software release planning, but can be adapted to a wider class of wicked planning problems. © Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract={In land management, conflicts are more frequent and stronger. Any important project on land becomes difficult to implement. MAGISTER (Multicriteria Analysis with GIS for TERritory) model proposes a decision support method to integrate multiple actors of land management. It is based on geographical information systems and multicriteria analysis. In land use problems, the study area is described by a set of homogeneous zones to reduce the numbers of alternatives. The homogeneity quality is assessed by use of a valued closeness relation developed in the domain of rough set theory. This function is based on the same principle as the valued outranking relation used in ELECTRE, which is then used to select the best zones, or classify them in predefined category. One application of the MAGISTER model concerns the realisation of a land suitability map for housing. Through eight criteria, this map integrates simultaneously the particularity of each place and the general principles of land management, which should be determined by decision-makers. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the selection of suitable renewable energy policy is very significant issue that could affect on environment and economic development. To address the issue, some researchers have focused on choosing the best renewable energy alternative by utilizing the decision-making analysis and fuzzy sets theory. In this paper, a new decision model based on modified elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) is presented under a hesitant fuzzy environment for solving the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems in energy sector. Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) is a powerful tool to cope with uncertainty in case of hesitant and incomplete information by considering some membership degrees for an energy alternative versus an evaluation criterion (attribute) under a set. In this model, a group of energy experts is provided to assess the potential alternatives among the conflicted attributes or criteria. Also, the decision matrix and relative importance of each attribute are considered by linguistic terms that can be transformed to hesitant fuzzy elements. In addition, the relative importance of each energy decision maker (DM) or expert is computed by proposed hesitant fuzzy modified preferences selection index (HF-M-PSI) method. Also, the significance of attributes is determined by an extended maximizing deviation method which is motivated by hesitant fuzzy Euclidean-Hausdorff distance measure. In this regard, opinions of each energy expert are applied to extend maximizing deviation method. Then, weights of attributes and experts are considered in the proposed hesitant fuzzy modified-ELECTRE (HF-M-ELECTRE) model. In the proposed decision model, the hesitant fuzzy effective outranking matrix may not help to rank the energy candidates. Thus, the proposed soft computing approach takes account of the thresholds as indifference, preference and veto for each attribute to compare the equivalent alternative. Finally, two real case studies in developing countries on renewable energy policy selection problem are presented to indicate the suitability and feasibility of the proposed HF-M-ELECTRE model in imprecise situations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Construction of residential buildings using off-site methods, in particular modular construction, is receiving considerable attention. However, the sustainability performance of modular buildings has rarely been investigated through a life cycle perspective. In this paper, a life cycle sustainability performance assessment framework is developed for modular buildings and its application is examined. In the first part of the paper, suitable life cycle sustainability performance criteria (SPCs) for modular buildings were developed and ranked. In this regard, potential SPCs were identified through a comprehensive literature review and expert interviews. These SPCs were then evaluated by construction experts through two questionnaire surveys against three evaluation criteria: applicability, data availability, and data accuracy. The evaluation criteria's weights were determined through a group decision making process using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. Consequently, the experts’ feedback was analyzed with the help of the Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) outranking MCDA method and all the SPCs were ranked within their associated sustainability categories (i.e., environmental, economic, and social). In the second part of the paper, application of the proposed framework has been discussed and validated through a case study of a modular building in British Columbia, Canada. Sustainability performance of modular buildings in the proposed framework were assessed by developing aggregated sustainability indices for the selected SPCs and comparing them with corresponding benchmarks. In this regard, appropriate sustainability performance indicators (SPIs) under each selected SPC have been developed and calculated. Consequently, through an aggregation process, sustainability indices are developed using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) MCDA method. In this paper, the environmental life cycle performance of the case study building has been benchmarked and recommendations have been made for performance improvements. This research is deemed useful for the construction practitioners since it provides a methodical framework for life cycle sustainability performance assessment of modular buildings and assists with the selection of sustainable methods of construction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sorting methods, in particular ELECTRE Tri methods, are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding to deal with ordinal classification problems. Problems of this kind encountered in practice involve the evaluation of different alternatives (actions) on several evaluation criteria that are structured in a hierarchical way. In order to deal with a hierarchical structure of criteria in decision problems, Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) has been recently proposed. In this paper, we apply the MCHP to the ELECTRE-Tri methods. In particular, we extend ELECTRE Tri-B, ELECTRE Tri-C and ELECTRE Tri-nC methods. We also adapt the MCHP concept to the case where interaction among evaluation criteria has either strengthening, or weakening, or antagonistic effect. Finally, we present an extension of the SRF method to determine the weights of criteria in case they are hierarchically structured. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this study is to propose an e-banking website quality assessment methodology based on an integrated fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE approach. The fuzzy set theory has been developed for dealing with the problems arising from the vagueness, ambiguity, and subjectivity of human judgment. In the proposed methodology, the weights of the criteria are generated by a fuzzy AHP analysis. Next, fuzzy ELECTRE is used to assess the quality levels of the websites. In the third step, a fuzzy dominance relation approach is used to rank the alternatives. In order to show the potentials of the proposed method, a case study in Turkish banking sector is reported together with a sensitivity analysis. © 2011 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.},

abstract={This paper presents Interactive Robustness analysis and parameters’ Inference for multicriteria Sorting problems (IRIS), a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to sort actions (projects, candidates, alternatives, clients, etc.) described by their performances on multiple criteria into an ordered set of categories defined a priori. It is based on the ELECTRE TRI sorting method, but does not require the decision maker (DM) to indicate precise values for all of the method’s parameters. More realistically, the software expects the DM to indicate some constraints that these parameters should respect, including sorting examples that the program should reproduce. If the constraints indicated by the DM do not contradict each other (i.e. form a consistent system), then IRIS infers a combination of parameter values that reproduces all the sorting examples, indicating also the range of possible assignments of actions to categories that would be possible without violating any of the stated constraints. If the constraints are contradictory (i.e. form an inconsistent system), then IRIS suggests a combination of parameter values that minimizes an error function and identifies alternative ways to restore the system’s consistency by removing some constraints. © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Despite that MCDA outranking methods can apply to any area, very few applications have been done to the tourism context. The case of four Hawaiian islands is used to show how ELECTRE I can be used to analyse tourism destination relative competitiveness. It is shown that ELECTRE I and Weighted-Sum Method (most widely MCDA applied approach) results differ. Empirical results illustrate the two different advantages of destinations (comparative and competitive advantages) and push to believe that competitive advantages are more closely linked to competitiveness than comparative ones. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

When resolving the proposed problem, the legal restrictions and the criteria (wind speed, area, slope, etc.) that influence the location will be considered. These will be defined in the form of thematic layers that will be entered into the GIS. Restrictions will be imposed taking into account the legislative framework of the study area so that, through their analysis and editing, it will be possible to reduce the initial area and obtain suitable sites where this type of facilities can be installed. Moreover, as the objective of the study is to select the locations and obtain a ranking two different models will be applied, initially a categorical assessment through a lexicographic order will be performed using the tools available in the GIS and, later it will be applied the ELECTRE-TRI methodology will be applied in order to make a comparison between the methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We describe ways of aiding decision making with a discrete set of alternatives. In many decision situations, it is not possible to obtain explicit preference information from the decision makers. Instead, useful decision-aid can be provided to the decision makers by describing what kind of weighting of the criteria result in certain choices of the alternatives. The suggested treatment is based on the basic ideas of the ELECTRE III method. The modelling of the preferences by pseudo-criteria is especially helpful in case the data, that is, the criterion values are imprecise. Unlike ELECTRE III, no ranking of the alternatives is produced. Based on a minimum-procedure in the exploitation of the outranking relations, we provide information about the weights of the criteria that make a certain alternative the best. We also present an interactive searching procedure in the weighting space. The auxiliary optimization problems to be solved are nondifferentiable. Cases with both single and multiple decision makers are considered.},

abstract={In most cases, ELECTRE methods just apply to traditional multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems with independent criteria. However, there exist more or less interdependences among criteria in actual situations. A special case is MCDM with prioritizations among criteria, called prioritized MCDM. In recent years, how to deal with MCDM problems in the environment of prioritized criteria becomes hot topic increasingly. Lots of existing methods, including PROMETHEE, are modified for the prioritized MCDM, but the advantages of ELECTRE have not been exploited to the prioritized MCDM. In my opinion, design specific ELECTRE methods for prioritized MCDM problems will benefit the developments of both ELECTRE and prioritized MCDM. In this paper, we firstly reformulate the expressions of concordance and discordance indices for use in the MCDM problems with dependent criteria, especially prioritized criteria, based on the concepts of fuzzy measures and digraphs respectively. After replacing the fuzzy measure by a prioritized measure, we successfully validate the concordance of an assertion under prioritized criteria. Furthermore, we design an approach to validate the discordance of the assertion based on a digraph constructed by the criteria and their prioritizations. Finally, we design three procedures to construct outranking relations in the prioritized MCDM environment according to the ideas of ELECTRE-I, ELECTRE-Iv, and ELECTRE-IS respectively. It is meaningful of this paper to provide a new idea to solve the prioritized MCDM problems and widen the application scope of ELECTRE methods by means of the reformulations of concordance and discordance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Over the past three decades, sustainable development (SD) has gained wide recognition among decision makers and politicians. Today, this concept aims to provide a healthier environment, more-improved society, and developed economy in both developed and developing world communities. Thus, to achieve a sustainable community, one needs to first better understand the underlying indicators and adopt appropriate sustainable policies in different sections and sectors of the community. As a vital component, the construction industry plays a key role in SD, which has drawn the attention of decision makers to find sustainable solutions worldwide for such an active industry. Industrial buildings, as a large segment of the construction industry, consume vast amounts of energy and financial resources and have a major role in job creation and improving the quality of life in a society. Therefore, this paper focuses on social, economic, and environmental aspects of SD of industrial buildings to evaluate the sustainable indicators and to develop a combinatory multi-criteria group decision-making framework for optimal selection of sustainable options of industrial buildings. The developed framework considers uncertainty alongside various preference orders and risk attitudes of decision makers -using utility functions. The decision making process consists of two stages: the first stage, takes the advantages of integration of utility function, ELECTRE I (the elimination and choice translating reality), and Grey theory to create the new method of Grey-Utility-ELECTRE to rank the feasible alternatives. And the second stage utilizes the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation operator to aggregate the preferences of environmental, social, and economic dimension, as three decision makers, to determine the final ranking. Because this research focuses on the sustainability of industrial buildings, the performance and capabilities of the developed framework are demonstrated using five petrochemical buildings of a petrochemical company in Iran, as a case study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In the recommended model, we examine sensitivity analysis of MDM methods to changes in criteria weight and result consistency of methods to changes in measurement scale and the way in which we formulate criteria. In the final phase of the model, we select the most suitable method to solve the observed problem and the optimal alternative. The model is tested on an example, when the optimal MDM method selection was required in order to determine the location of the logistical center. During the selection process, TOPSIS, COPRAS, VIKOR and ELECTRE methods were considered. VIKOR method demonstrated the biggest stability of rankings and was selected as the most fit method for ranking the locations of the logistical center. Results of the demonstrated analysis indicate sensitivity of standard MDM methods to criteria considered in this work. Therefore, it is necessary, to take into account stability of the considered method during the selection process of the optimal method.},

abstract={Multicriterion decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used to analyze a multiobjective wastewater management problem in order to select an appropriate management scheme. A specific case study consisting of 15 alternative management schemes is evaluated with respect to 12 noncommensurable, discrete criteria, using three different MCDM techniques; compromise programming (CP), cooperative game theory (CGT), and ELECTRE I. The case study is the Nogales International Wastewater Management Project, which treats wastewater coming from the twin cities of Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. The problem is formulated in a multicriterion context in terms of objectives, specifications, criteria, criterion scales, and construction of an evaluation matrix that consists of the alternative versus criteria array. Analyses of the matrix using the MCDM techniques result in selecting the most satisfying alternative in the case of CP and CGT and narrowing the choice to a few non-dominated alternatives (here, two) in the case of ELECTRE I. © ASCE.},

Criteria representing pumping yield, total costs, and water-shortage risk are considered. The management model expressed in such a multicriterion form is based on the finite-element method and a combined embedding/response matrix method. This model is used to generate a discrete representation of a nondominated solution set. Four MCDM techniques: Compromise programming, ELECTRE III, multiattribute utility function, and UTA method representing, respectively, distance-based, outranking, and utility (multiplicative and additive forms) approaches are examined as potential decision-aid tools to select the appropriate management scheme. Comparison of the results shows that these quite different MCDM techniques lead to a similar subset of recommended solutions. Adequacy of these techniques for ground-water management is discussed from the points of view of technique characteristics, decision maker’s expectations, analyst’s knowledge required, and method output, that is, ranking of alternatives. © ASCE.},

We first propose an entropy measure for Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (AIVIFS) and establish an entropy weight model, which is then used to determine the objective criteria weights of the alternatives, and then we extend the Electre I method to take account of the decision makers' Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (AIVIFN) assessment information. Based on a graphical representation of the outranking relations, a superiority index and a global superiority index are defined, and then used to choose an optimal alternative or the best non-inferior alternative(s) in the group decision making process. Finally, we give an illustration of the proposed method using a practical supplier selection example, and then compare this method with other current methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The increasing demand on productivity and quality requires machines to be constantly available for production. It is therefore crucial to develop an adequate maintenance programme. To facilitate this, several criteria need to be considered, such as: downtime, maintenance frequency, spare parts costs, bottleneck impacts, etc. In the literature, a strategy is selected for each machine with a multi-criteria decision choice method. However, before making an informed decision, each strategy needs to be tested on each machine and then their performances evaluated with a multicriteria decision method. This is time-consuming, inefficient and often unfeasible. As machines[U+05F3] performances are usually systematically collected by industries, a much more practical approach is to assign machines to a maintenance strategy. This is referred to as a sorting problem. However, this problem cannot be solved by existing multi-criteria sorting methods because maintenance strategies cannot always be completely ordered: incomparable strategies exist. Recently, a Decision Making Grid was proposed to allocate machines to incomparable strategies. However, this technique can only be applied to problems with two criteria. In this paper, we have developed ELECTRE-SORT, a new sorting method that is able to consider an unlimited number of criteria in order to assign machines to incomparable strategies. A case study illustrates that ELECTRE-SORT provides more precise and flexible maintenance strategies than the Decision Making Grid. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The unequal area facility layout problem (UA-FLP) comprises a class of extremely difficult and widely applicable optimization problems arising in diverse areas and meeting the requirements for real-world applications. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have recently proven their effectiveness in finding (sub) optimal solutions to many NP-hard problems such as UA-FLP. A main issue in such approach is related to the genetic encoding and to the evolutionary mechanism implemented, which must allow the efficient explo- ration of a wide solution space, preserving the feasibility of the solutions and ensuring the convergence towards the optimum. In addition, in realistic situations where several design issues must be taken into account, the layout problem falls in the broader frame work of multi-objective optimization problems. To date, there are only a few multi-objective FLP approaches, and most of them employ over-simplified opti- mization techniques which eventually influence the quality of the solutions obtained and the perfor- mance of the optimization procedure. In this paper, this difficulty is overcome by approaching the problem in two subsequent steps: in the first step, the Pareto-optimal solutions are determined by employing Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) implementing four separate fitness functions within a Pareto evolutionary procedure, following the general structure of Non-dominated Ranking Genetic Algorithm (NRGA) and the subsequent selection of the optimal solution is carried out by means of the multi-criteria decision-making procedure Electre. This procedure allows the decision maker to express his preferences on the basis of the knowledge of candidate solution set. Quantitative and quali- tative objectives are considered referring to the slicing-tree layout representation scheme. The numerical results obtained outperform previous referenced approaches, thus confirming the effectiveness of the proce dure proposed. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper is described the implementation of a multi-criteria analysis in order to answer a question of researchers of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) who assess the impact of agricultural practices on the environmental components. They were particularly interested in differentiating cropping systems (CSs) as a function of their impact on groundwater quality. In order to give effect to this differentiation, members of the Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Modelisation de Systemes pour l'Aide a la Decision (LAMSADE) proposed a way of sorting CSs using the ELECTRE TRI method. Four categories of impact were defined and three families of criteria were built up. The main debate was about the nature of criteria: if basic data are used, the number of the criteria is high; if aggregated data are used, exchanges of information are tedious. In spite of difficulties, the study has been of important value for the agronomic researchers. Firstly, it helps them to work with decision-makers, such as the Water Agency: it allows farmers to be given concrete examples of CSs which preserve groundwater quality. Secondly, the multi-criteria methodology used seems to fit their researches: they are indeed now using the same approach to differentiate CSs on the basis of their impact on wild fauna or landscape quality.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to balance social, environmental and economic criteria, alongside related ethical issues, in the supplier selection process when outsourcing activities in the textile industry. We propose a multi-criteria model to support supplier selection process, whereby suppliers are allocated to classes based on sustainability, integrating the opinions of customers and managers. The model has three phases: i) criteria definition, in which the Copeland method is used to aggregate criteria reported in the literature for a group of decision makers (customers and expert managers); ii) elicitation of the perceptions of decision-makers, about criteria and the definition of weights for these criteria using the AHP method, and iii) multi-criteria classification of suppliers performed using the ELECTRE-TRI method. A numerical application was performed in the textile sector in order to test results. The main results show that suppliers can be classified, balancing social, environmental and economic criteria and related ethical issues, considering opinions from customers and experts. The theoretical implications can benefit researchers who can apply the model in future research into economic, environmental and social interactions. Managers can use the structure presented in this model to improve supplier selection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The approach followed combines the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to manage and process spatial information with the flexibility of Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA) to assess factual information (e.g. soil type, slope, infrastructures) with more subjective information (e.g. expert opinion). The MCDA method used is ELECTRE TRI, an outranking-type method that yields a classification of the possible alternatives.

Major features and basic notions of MCDM/A methodology are presented. Different categories of MCDM/A methods are characterized and classified. Two case studies demonstrate possible applications of MCDM/A methodology in public transportation. In the first case study multiple objective evaluation of the mass transit system developments' scenarios is carried out. Four variants of the mass transit system are evaluated by a consistent family of criteria with an application of ELECTRE III method. The second case study refers to optimization of the crew size in the mass transit system operated by a public transportation company (PTC). Multiple objective mathematical programing problem is formulated and solved by a combination of an original, customized heuristic procedure implemented in a computer software PEOPLE and the Light Beam Search (LBS) method. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) is a multi-criteria decision support method for multiple decision-makers (DMs) in discrete problems. SMAA does not require explicit or implicit preference information from the DMs. Instead, the method is based on exploring the weight space in order to describe the valuations that would make each alternative the preferred one. Partial preference information can be represented in the weight space analysis through weight distributions. In this paper we compare two variants of the SMAA method using randomly generated test problems with 2-12 criteria and 4-12 alternatives. In the original SMAA, a utility or value function models the DMs' preference structure, and the inaccuracy or uncertainty of the criteria is represented by probability distributions. In SMAA-3, ELECTRE III-type pseudo-criteria are used instead. Both methods compute for each alternative an acceptability index measuring the variety of different valuations that supports this alternative, and a central weight vector representing the typical valuations resulting in this decision. We seek answers to three questions: (1) how similar are the results provided by the decision models, (2) what kind of systematic differences exists between the models, and (3) how could one select indifference and preference thresholds of the pseudo-criteria model to match a utility model with given probability distributions? © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The selection of the optimal supply is an open and crucial issue in supply chain management (SCM), which can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem where the expression and processing of uncertain information could be involved. The purpose of this paper is to develop an elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE)-based MCDM method where the evaluation information is expressed and handled by a Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). DST is a primary methodology for uncertainty modeling. In this paper, the weight of the criteria and the performance of each alternative are expressed by linguistic terms and confidence levels, which are then converted to basic probability assignment (BPA) representations. To aggregate evaluations of different experts more rationally and efficiently, a discounting method in DST is presented based on the proposed concept of evidential reliability. In addition, as one family of MCDM models, the ELECTRE method is famous for its outranking relations to rank a set of alternatives. As an extension, synthetic weight, including subjective and objective weights, is applied to determine the concepts of concordance and discordance. The proposed DS-ELECTRE approach not only maintains the advantage of the DST that directly represents and handles uncertainty but also can play the role of the ELECTRE method in analyzing outranking relations among alternatives. An illustrative numerical example is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DS-ELECTRE method. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The implementations of Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) category to complex multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) scenarios have been included in thousands areas. Outranking methods such as PROMETHEE II are also greatly employed in energy planning application. In MCGDM methods if decision makers (DMs) are not able to treat precise data in order to define their preferences, the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory enables them. IFS attributes are connected with the degree of membership and non-membership, and can be used to draw uncertainty in group decision-making situations. In this paper, a new version of the PROMETHEE II method is proposed, aiming at solving MCGDM problems. Linguistic variables are expressed in the membership function and non-membership function of IFS which are used to assess the weights of all criteria and the ratings of each alternative with respect to each criteria. Conditional normalized Euclidean distance measure is adopted to measure deviations between alternatives on intuitionistic fuzzy set. Then, a ranking algorithm is applied to indicate the order of superiority of alternatives. Finally, a practical example is given to an application of sustainable energy planning to verify our proposed method. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done among the proposed PROMETHEE II method and the intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (IF-TOPSIS) method and elimination and choice translating reality method (IF-ELECTRE). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The problem of selection or ranking of alternatives based on multiple criteria is not an easy problem, neither economically nor mathematically. The recent advancements in various structural systems have made the selection of the appropriate structural system for a specific project a challenging decision-making process. This process involves different economic and technical criteria representing the availability of experienced technicians and engineers and necessary machinery and construction materials. Economic life cycle, environmental protection related issues, safety of the project site, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes are also issues related to the country and location in which the construction project takes place, and they should also be addressed in the decision-making process. In this paper, a new algorithm combining two well-known multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III) and preference ranking organization method for enrich evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), have been specially developed for ranking of structural systems. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to group decision-making cases. In addition, the decision matrix data, criteria weights, preference, indifference, and veto thresholds are set as interval values to consider uncertainties in the decision-making procedure. The proposed methodology considers veto threshold, provide complete ranking, exempts the preference functions and includes conceptions such as risk, uncertainty, and reliability with interval approach. The proposed algorithm has been utilized in selecting the appropriate structural system in a low-rise multihousing project in Iran. In this case study, sixteen criteria have been used to select the best structural system between eight alternatives considering relevant uncertainties in the judgments of three groups of stakeholders (owner, consultants, and contractors). The results of the case study showed that the proposed methodology can be used as a proper tool for decision making in the construction management processes. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={In this article, an original multi-criteria approach is applied to multi-source systems used for the design and the choice of the optimal alternative. The high number of alternatives and potential solutions when dealing with multi-source systems require a decision support method to be implemented and easy to use. Information data on the economic variables, energy performance and impact on the environment of the systems are presently data which analysis and quantification is difficult. To deal with this high level of complexity and uncertainty, an evaluation approach is needed. The multi-criteria decision support methodology concept is described (ELECTRE III) and then applied for a case study. The decision support algorithm has its bases on the developed models and makes the outranking of possible solutions. It is also shown that multi-criteria analysis can provide a technical-scientific decision-making support that is capable to justify the clearly rank of the alternatives in the renewable energy sector. The use of multi-criteria decision aid for assessing the multi-source systems showed encouraging results and interesting insights. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Prescriptive decision analysis has become established internationally as a tool to support decision making. Its role is generally agreed; it is a tool which helps decision makers (DMs) explore problems and possible strategies for solving them. Through application of a specific analysis, the DMs are able to learn about their preferences and discover their real objectives. Although the function of prescriptive decision analysis is generally accepted, the choice of underlying mathematical model on which the analysis is based is a matter for much discussion. Different schools of thought have led to the development of a number of alternative methodologies. The different methodologies have arisen not just from contrasting intuitive ideas for solving multicriteria problems, but also from diverse views of the DM(s) and what information they ‘know’. Therefore, comparisons of decision analysis techniques have been confounded by both the mathematical model and the vision of the DM to whom this model has been applied. However, I have argued that the adoption of a particular technique does not necessarily require a particular model of the DM, and therefore, competing tools should and can be applied to the same problem. © 1996 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract={Multicriteria sorting methods aim at assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories. We consider a sorting method in which categories are defined by profiles separating consecutive categories. An alternative a is assigned to the lowest category for which a is at least as good as the lower profile of this category, for a majority of weighted criteria. This method, that we call MR-Sort, corresponds to a simplified version of ELECTRE Tri. To elicit the values for the profiles and weights, we consider a learning procedure. This procedure relies on a set of known assignment examples to find parameters compatible with these assignments. This is done using mathematical programming techniques. The focus of this study is experimental. In order to test the mathematical formulation and the parameters learning method, we generate random samples of simulated alternatives. We perform experiments in view of answering the following questions: (a) assuming the learning set is generated using a MR-Sort model, is the learning method able to restore the original sorting model? (b) is the learning method able to do so even when the learning set contains errors? (c) is MR-Sort model able to represent a learning set generated with another sorting method, i.e. can the models be discriminated on an empirical basis? © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Most portfolio selection models found in the financial literature rely on an estimate of the probability distribution of returns to describe risk. Recent controversy over the appropriate description of risk, the psychological (and controversial) nature of probabilistic estimates and the potential bias introduced by estimation errors has raised doubts as to the adequacy of the frequency function as a unique measure of risk for portfolio selection. This paper applies an alternative approach, namely the Electre methods, to portfolio comparisons. The application of this analytical technique, based on ‘outranking’ relationships, brings in a new perspective to this problem. It puts particular emphasis on a multicriteria analysis that integrates into a systematic framework the various dimensions of risk seen by portfolio managers. Problems with respect to the heterogeneity of measurement units, the conflicting nature of portfolio evaluations and the imprecise nature of the data used are taken care of in our approach, where the various criteria are used to derive the efficient set. © 1988 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report a study on the application of interpretative structural modelling (ISM) integrated with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques for enabling the sustainability supplier selection. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, two approaches of hybrid MCDM methods are followed and the selection of sustainable supplier was based on the comparative results obtained from both the methods. The first hybrid approach is ISM – analytic network process (ANP) – ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE II) and the second hybrid approach is ISM – ANP – Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). ISM was used to identify the inter relationship between the criteria. Inter-relationship of criteria obtained from ISM will serve as an input for ANP. The weights obtained from ANP will be used in ELECTRE II and VIKOR. ELECTRE II is an outranking method, whereas VIKOR is a compromise ranking method; comparison of both the methods was carried out in this study. Findings: In this study, two modules ISM–ANP – ELECTRE and ISM–ANP – VIKOR were compared for the problem of sustainable supplier selection. ELECTRE results with a single solution showed that Supplier 2 can be selected as the best supplier; VIKOR result shows that Supplier 1 and Supplier 2 can be selected as the best suppliers. Originality/value: The selection of sustainable supplier considering the interrelationship of criteria using ISM and ranking the alternatives using compromise and outranking techniques was found to be original and novel contribution of the author. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In recent years, the quest for more comprehensiveness, structure and transparency in reimbursement decision-making in healthcare has prompted the research into alternative decision-making frameworks. In this environment, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is arising as a valuable tool to support healthcare decision-making. In this paper, we present the main MCDA decision support methods (elementary methods, value-based measurement models, goal programming models and outranking models) using a case study approach. For each family of methods, an example of how an MCDA model would operate in a real decision-making context is presented from a critical perspective, highlighting the parameters setting, the selection of the appropriate evaluation model as well as the role of sensitivity and robustness analyses. This study aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to use MCDA methods for reimbursement decision-making in healthcare. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={Corsica island has been subjected to an unprecedented abundance of photovoltaic plant projects since its energy policy is focused on renewable resources. Concerned public institutions require specific tools to select the most relevant projects among numerous projects proposed in a transparent and prudent way.To this end, a multicriteria decision aiding method was developed to select among 16 projects that have been proposed on farming fields in Haute Corse. This paper details the main stages in the multicriteria methodology, including criteria and constraint definition, criteria weight set calculations, threshold and concordance level determination and the implementation of the chosen multicriteria model, ELECTRE IS. Thus, considering different points of view (energy, geo-economic, ecological, visual impact, territorial use, financial effect), eight criteria have been defined, one of which is optional. The method applied to the reviewed data allowed building 6 weight sets, while a concordance level of 2/3. Using this method, based on our criteria sets and according to the weights and concordance levels determined by the client, 4 projects were selected among the 16 initial ones, with the robustness of these results being tested through all criteria weight sets and different concordance level applications. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Industrialization and urbanization have led to the rapid development of the building industry. To alleviate the adverse impact on the environment, natural resources, health and comfort of inhabitants, sustainable principles have been incorporated into the design, construction, decoration, operation, and maintenance of buildings. Among all these endeavors, sustainable building material selection is diffusely regarded as the simplest and most essential way of achieving sustainability. To this end, this paper develops a novel hybrid multi-criteria group decision making model for sustainable building material selection under uncertainty. The information representation construction used for alternative-criteria assessments in this model is a brand-new notion called Basic Uncertain Linguistic Information, which is capable of handling the qualitative performance estimates as well as its partial reliability. Multiple stakeholders are usually responsible for sustainable building material selection, and therefore, the fact that multiple perspectives are involved in the collective decision-making efforts is revealed by a Consensus Reaching Process to reach a decision reflecting at least a majority-based agreement among them. The Quality Function Deployment-based approach to determining comprehensive importance ratings of assessment criteria is further proposed to take into account diversifying sustainable building material requirements from different stakeholders. Subsequently, the ELECTRE III methodology, which models the heterogeneity and non-compensation among assessment criteria as well as their qualitative essence, is introduced to determine the ultimate priorities of alternative sustainable building materials. Finally, sensitive and comparative analyses are performed to verify the advantages of the proposed model in comparison with several existing methodologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) or Evidence Theory is regarded as one of the leading theories for modeling uncertainty in imprecise situations. The main advantage of this theory arises from the possibility of combining different bodies of evidence originally developed by using Dempster's combination rule. However, this rule leads to counter-intuitive results when the bodies of evidence conflict with each other to a high degree. Thus, different combinations of conflict management rules have been developed over the years where, regardless of the method used, what should be identified first of all is the level of conflict between the bodies of evidence. Therefore, different metrics were used to classify or quantify the conflict but no single one of these was successful because it is impracticable to represent all situations of conflict in this theory by using only one metric. Therefore, the contribution of this article is to analyze conflict within DST by using a multi-criteria analysis, for which the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method considered was ELECTRE TRI. On modeling the problem, three classes of conflict (low, medium and high), were considered. To validate the model, a numerical analysis was conducted that included the use of a method to point up conflict so as to infer parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article presents a methodology to classify light-duty vehicles according to their environmental impacts. The classification is based on Life-Cycle Impact Assessment indicators and vehicle operation indicators, which are aggregated using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. In contrast with most literature combining Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and MCDA, vehicles are not compared directly; they are compared to pre-established profiles defining a set of classes. These profiles are established relatively to the impacts of the country's light-duty fleet. The ELECTRE TRI method is chosen for MCDA classification, thus avoiding complete substitutability among criteria and allowing for imprecision in the data. MCDA typically incorporates the subjective values of decision makers, namely through criteria weighting. To obtain conclusions that are not contingent on a given weight vector, we consider a space of weight vectors defined by constraints with a clear rationale and obtain all the possible results compatible with those constraints. The methodology is applied to classify six vehicles available in Portugal with different powertrains: Gasoline and Diesel Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (10 and 40-mile battery range) and Battery Electric Vehicle. The discussion suggests how this methodology might be useful for a decision-making entity that wishes to classify vehicles according to their environmental impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The MCDM techniques used for the evaluation are composite programming, compromise programming, ELECTRE II, Regime method, and Evamix method; these techniques can be classified according to data availability and objectives (prefeasibility and feasibility). Furthermore, the WEI is improved to reflect the preferences of the residents with regard to management objectives through weights (of PFD, PSD, and PWQD) obtained from questionaires of residents.

Actual CDM practice has shown that projects are largely initiated by the demand for relatively low-cost certified emission reductions, leading to a series of ad-hoc projects, rather than serving the overall host countries' sustainable development needs and priorities. In the above framework, the study aims to direct CDM towards national sustainable development priorities, through the identification of sustainable energy technology priorities for electricity generation in five examined developing countries, namely Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. The current approach lays emphasis on the formulation of the process so as to be relatively straightforward to incorporate direct experts' preferences as well as trying to deal with the needs of flexibility and validity, through the use of an existing Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, namely the Electre TRI method. © 2009 International Energy Initiative.},

In Greece, this interest is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy exploitation, due to a favourable legislative framework and the important wind potential available in several Greek regions. In such endowed regions, a very high number of applications were submitted to the competent authority, most of which compete for the same most attractive (windy) sites. The selection among these applications is a multicriteria problem that has been solved with the support of a Decision-Aid tool combining the multicriteria classification method ELECTRE-TRI with Integer Linear Programming. The developed approach takes into account both, the performances of the applications to the evaluation criteria, as well as a number of technical and policy constraints.},

The EIA procedure generated a large amount of data about the different impacts of the alternatives. For this group decision making problem we developed the SMAA-3 decision support method which does not require any explicit preference information from the decision makers during the procedure.

Thus, the application of transportation means to improving and controlling the air quality of metropolitan areas is a correct and functioning method. Among several feasible improvement policies, transportation system management (TSM) is a kind of low-cost method which can be expected to show effects in a short-term period. It would necessitate a great deal of manpower, effort and time if each one of these methods were to be measure precisely and objectively. As a result, the utilization of an expert evaluation model to extract professional knowledge from various fields so as to located views of consensus would result in a successful decision-making method under circumstances where information is incomplete. This paper puts forward three phases of a multicriteria evaluation model which will, at the onset, perform consensus elimination under key criteria so as to find out non-dominated strategies; next, every expert uses the ELECTRE III model to rank non-dominated strategies under multiple criteria; the consensus ranking method proposed by Cook and Seiford (1978) is then employed for uncovering the ranking of minimal recognition differences from all experts. This paper takes Taipei city as an illustration to elaborate the intended method. © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper aims to propose novel Chebyshev distance measures for Pythagorean membership grades and establish their based elimination and choice translating reality method (ELECTRE) for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems under uncertainty of Pythagorean fuzziness. Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets have a significant effect on fuzzy modeling for intelligent informatics and decision support because the degrees of membership, non-membership, and indeterminacy, strength of commitment, and direction of commitment featured by PF information are extended for a wider coverage of information span. The theory of PF sets is a powerful tool in dealing with imprecise and ambiguous evaluations for realistic problems and modeling intelligent decision making for complex systems. This paper focuses on both theory and applications of the Chebyshev metric for PF contexts, and special attention is devoted to the theoretical development of Chebyshev distances in connection with Pythagorean membership grades based on various types of representations. To surmount the difficulties confronted by the existing measures, such as low comprehensivity, incomparability in scaling, ignorance of square degrees in metric specification, double weighting, and inappropriate normalization, this paper makes a comprehensive comparison to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Chebyshev distance measures. To support decision making within complicated PF environments, this paper develops an extended ELECTRE approach based on the Chebyshev distance measure to conduct multiple criteria decision analysis involving PF information for determining partial and complete rankings of candidate alternatives. In particular, this paper constructs novel Chebyshev metric-based preference functions depending on the individual characteristics of the criteria. The developed PF ELECTRE approach leads to using all the information that characterizes a PF set via the concepts of the scalar function and various Chebyshev metric-based comparison indices, such as (net) concordance indices, (net) discordance indices, and the overall precedence index. Practical applications with a comparative analysis in the field of bridge-superstructure construction are conducted to examine the usefulness and advantages of the proposed methodology in the real world. © 2019},

abstract={The implementation of Sustainable Development (SD) within an Organization is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to deal with conflicting and incommensurable aspects such as environmental, economic and social dimensions. In this paper we have used a Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) methodology to cope with these difficulties. MCDA methodology offers the opportunity to avoid monetary valuation of the different dimensions of the SD. These dimensions are not substitutable for one another and all have a role to play. There is an abundance of possible aggregation procedures in MCDA methodology. In this paper we have proposed an innovative method to choose a suitable aggregation procedure for SD problems. Real life case studies of the implementation of an outranking approach (i.e.; ELECTRE) and of a mono-criterion synthesis approach (i.e.; MAUT approaches based on the Choquet integral) were done to respectively rank 22 SD strategic actions within an expertise Institute and rank 20 practical operational actions to control energy consumption of the Institute's buildings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The main aim of this study is the integrated assessment of a proposed Waste-to-Energy facility that could contribute in the Municipal Solid Waste Management system of the Region of Central Greece. In the context of this paper alternative transfer schemes for supplying the candidate facility were assessed considering local conditions and economical criteria. A mixed-integer linear programming model was applied for the determination of optimum locations of Transfer Stations for an efficient supplying chain between the waste producers and the Waste-to-Energy facility. Moreover different Regional Waste Management Scenarios were assessed against multiple criteria, via the Multi Criteria Decision Making method ELECTRE III. The chosen criteria were total cost, Biodegradable Municipal Waste diversion from landfill, energy recovery and Greenhouse Gas emissions and the analysis demonstrated that a Waste Management Scenario based on a Waste-to-Energy plant with an adjacent landfill for disposal of the residues would be the best performing option for the Region, depending however on the priorities of the decision makers. In addition the study demonstrated that efficient planning is necessary and the case of three sanitary landfills operating in parallel with the WtE plant in the study area should be avoided. Moreover alternative cases of energy recovery of the candidate Waste-to-Energy facility were evaluated against the requirements of the new European Commission Directive on waste in order for the facility to be recognized as recovery operation. The latter issue is of high significance and the decision makers in European Union countries should take it into account from now on, in order to plan and implement facilities that recover energy efficiently. Finally a sensitivity check was performed in order to evaluate the effects of increased recycling rate, on the calorific value of treated Municipal Solid Waste and the gate fee of the candidate plant and found that increased recycling efforts would not diminish the potential for incineration with energy recovery from waste and neither would have adverse impacts on the gate fee of the Waste-to-Energy plant. In general, the study highlighted the need for efficient planning in solid waste management, by taking into account multiple criteria and parameters and utilizing relevant tools and methodologies into this context. © 2009.},

abstract={In a heterogeneous wireless network environment services are ubiquitously delivered over multiple wireless access technologies. Ranking of the alternatives and selection of the most efficient and suitable access network to meet the QoS requirements of a specific service, as these are defined by the user, constitutes thus an important issue. Decisions on which network to connect to are however difficult to be reached, since multiple factors of different relative importance have to be taken into consideration. This paper addresses this difficulty by adopting Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods. Fuzzy AHP, a MADM method, is initially applied to determine the weights of certain Quality of Service indicators that act as the criteria impacting the decision process. The fuzzy extension of the method, and consequently the use of fuzzy numbers, is adopted in order to incorporate the existence of fuzziness as a result of subjective evaluations. Afterwards, ELECTRE, a ranking MADM method, is applied to rank the alternatives, in this case wireless networks, based on their overall performance. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences.© Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2010.},

abstract={Electre is an important outranking method developed in the area of decision-aiding. Data mining is a vital developing technique that receives contributions from lots of disciplines such as databases, machine learning, information retrieval, statistics, and so on. Techniques in outranking approaches, e.g. Electre, could also contribute to the development of data mining. In this research, we address the following two issues: a) why and how to combine Electre with case-based reasoning (CBR) to generate corresponding hybrid models by extending the fundamental principles of Electre into CBR; b) the effect on predictive performance by employing evidence vetoing the assertion on the base of evidence supporting the assertion. The similarity measure of CBR is implemented by revising and fulfilling three basic ideas of Electre, i.e. assertion that two cases are indifferent, evidence supporting the assertion, and evidence vetoing the assertion. Two corresponding CBR models are constructed by combining principles of the Electre decision-aiding method with CBR. The first one, named Electre-CBR-I, derives from evidence supporting the assertion. The other one, named Electre-CBR-II, derives from both evidence supporting and evidence vetoing the assertion. Leave-one-out cross-validation and hold-out method are integrated to form 30-times hold-out method. In financial distress mining, data was collected from Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, ANOVA was employed to select features that are significantly different between companies in distress and health, 30-times hold-out method was used to assess predictive performance, and grid-search technique was utilized to search optimal parameters. Original data distributions were kept in the experiment. Empirical results of long-term financial distress prediction with 30 initial financial ratios and 135 initial pairs of samples indicate that Electre-CBR-I outperforms Electre-CBR-II and other comparative CBR models, and Electre-CBR-II outperforms the other comparative CBR models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes an optimisation model for the allocation of multi-skilled human resources to RD projects, considering individual workers as entities having different knowledge, experience and ability. The model focuses on three fundamental aspects of human resources: the different skill levels, the learning process and the social relationships existing in working teams. The resolution approach for the multi-objective problem consists of two steps: firstly, a set of non-dominated solutions is obtained by exploring the optimal Pareto frontier and secondly, based on further information, the ELECTRE III method is utilised to select the best compromise with regards to the considered objectives. The uncertainty associated to each solution is modelled by fuzzy numbers and used in establishing the threshold values of ELECTRE III, while the weights of the objectives are determined taking into account the influence that each objective has on the others.},

abstract={Abstract In the current paper a novel procedure to select the optimal solution both for seismic retrofitting of existing RC buildings and for super-elevation of existing masonry constructions has been implemented by using three different Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) (TOPSIS, ELECTRE and VIKOR) methods. The procedure application has been faced with reference to two case studies. The first intervention has been studied on a real full-scale 3D RC structure retrofitted with different seismic protection devices mainly based on metal materials, whose performances were experimentally evaluated in a previous research project. All the applied MCDM methods have provided the same result, that is the dominating role exerted by aluminium shear panels for seismic retrofitting of the analysed structure. On the other hand, different innovative and traditional constructive systems have been examined to increase the number of floors of existing masonry buildings. The effectiveness of these interventions in improving the base building behaviour has been proved on a typical building of the South Italy. The study results, achieved by using the three MCDM methods inspected, have provided as an optimal solution the cold-formed steel systems thanks to their prerequisites of lightness, economy and sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The problem tackled by the present paper concerns the selection of the elements of a repairable and stochastically deteriorating multi-component system to replace (replacements configuration) during each scheduled and periodical system stop within a finite optimization cycle, by ensuring the simultaneous minimization of both the expected total maintenance cost and the system unavailability. To solve the considered problem, a combined approach between multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) resolution techniques is proposed. In particular, the ε constraint method is used to single out the optimal Pareto frontier whereas the ELECTRE III multi-criteria decision support method is proposed to support the selection of the replacements configuration that represents the best compromise among the considered objectives. The proposed approach is sequentially applied at each scheduled system stop by allowing the dynamic updating of the information about the decisional context in which the decision maker has to operate. To illustrate the whole procedure a numerical case study is solved for different hypothesized scenarios related to the importance attributed by the decision maker to the system unavailability and the maintenance cost objectives. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that the deformations of empirical data, caused by the usage of normalisations, could affect the final choices. If the MADM methods are based on normalised ratings of the SN or VN type, then their results could depend on: 1) the measurement units used for quantitative attributes that are measurable by interval scales, and 2) the type of Likert scale used for measuring qualitative attributes. It also shows that the MADM methods violate certain conditions of consistent choice and that this violation could be attributed to SN, LN and VN normalisation procedures.},

In an ordinal classification problem, the categories (also called classes in related literature) are pre-defined and ordered, from the best to the worst or from the worst to the best. The actions (not necessarily known a priori) are assigned to the different ordered categories. Several ELECTRE type methods were designed to deal with this kind of problem. However, none of them proposes a characterization of the categories through a set of limiting profiles. This is the novelty of the current method, which may be considered as an extension of ELECTRE TRI-B. It fulfills a set of structural requirements: uniqueness of the assignments, independence, monotonicity, homogeneity, conformity, and stability with respect to merging and splitting operations. All these features will be presented in the current paper and illustrated through three examples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Dealing with spatial decision problems means combining and transforming geographical data (input) into a resultant decision (output), interfacing a Geographical Information System (GIS) with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods. The conventional MCDA approach assumes the spatial homogeneity of alternatives within the case study area, although it is often unrealistic. On the other side, GIS provides excellent data acquisition, storage, manipulation and analysis capabilities, but in the case of a value structure analysis this capability is lower. For these reasons, several studies in the last twenty years have given attention to MCDA-GIS integration and to the development of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS). Hitherto, most of these applications are based only on a formal integration between the two approaches. In this paper, we propose a complete MCDA-GIS integration with a plurality of MCDA methodologies, grouped in a suite. More precisely, we considered an open-source GIS (GRASS GIS 6.4) and a modular package including five MCDA modules based on five different methodologies. The methods included are: ELECTRE I, Fuzzy set, REGIME analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. Thanks to the modular nature of the package, it is possible to add new methods without modifying the existing structure. To present the suite, we applied each module to the same case study, making comparisons. The strong points of the MCDA-GIS integration we developed are its open-source setting and the user friendly interface, both thanks to GRASS GIS, and the use of raster data. Moreover, our suite is a genuine case of perfect integration, where the spatial nature of criteria is always present. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The proposed approach is based on the ELECTRE-TRI multi-criteria method and allows the consideration of different kinds of impacts, although avoiding difficult measurements and unit conversions. The decision is based on all the significant effects of the initiative, both positive and negative, including ancillary effects often forgotten in cost-benefit analysis. The ELECTRE-TRI, as most multi-criteria methods, provides to the decision maker the ability of controlling the relevance each impact can have on the final decision in a transparent way. The decision support process encompasses a robustness analysis, which, together with a good documentation of the parameters supplied into the model, should support sound decisions. The models were tested with a set of real-world initiatives and compared with possible decisions based on cost-benefit analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a good insight into the use of fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP) approach that is a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in evaluating the benefits of information-sharing decision problems. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the integration of AHP with the fuzzy synthetic extent analysis method (fuzzy AHP) is proposed in evaluating the benefits of information-sharing decision problems as a framework to guide managers. Findings - Findings demonstrate that the customer requirement and operational information alternatives are the preferred key decisions, which all supply chain partners might agree to share with one another. Further, it can also be concluded that the planning and financial information alternatives have almost the same importance. Research limitations/implications - Fuzzy AHP is a highly complex methodology and requires more numerical calculations in assessing composite priorities than the traditional AHP and hence it increases the effort. In addition, fuzzy methodology could be extended with the other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods such as Analytical Network Process (ANP), TOPSIS, ELECTRE and DEA techniques in solving such a problem. Originality/value - There is a lack of research in the literature to deal directly with the uncertainty of human judgements in evaluating the benefits of various information-sharing decisions in a supply chain. Therefore, fuzzy AHP is an appropriate methodology to select the various types of information and has the ability to be used as a decision-making analysis tool since it handles uncertain and imprecise data. In addition, the paper is especially of interest to managers as they make decisions on which types of information they should share with their supply chain partners. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité, in French) is an effective multiple criteria decision making method based on comparative analysis. Among the family of the ELECTRE methods and their extensions, the ELECTRE III is widely used since it can tackle uncertain and imprecise information. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set can represent people's perceptions more comprehensively and flexibly than exact numbers especially in cognitive complex decision-making process. In this paper, we develop an integrated method based on the ELECTRE III to handle the cognitive complex multiple experts multiple criteria decision making problems in which the cognitive complex information is represented by hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and the outranking relations between alternatives are calculated by a novel score-function-based distance measure between hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements. A combinative weight-determining method involving both subjective and objective opinions of experts is introduced to derive the weights of criteria. After obtaining the ranking of alternatives from each experts’ decision matrix by the distillation algorithm, the weighted Borda rule is implemented to aggregate the rankings of alternatives regarding different experts. Some ordinal consensus measures are introduced to identify the reliability of the final ranking result. An application of hospital ranking in China is provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Group decision making (GDM) is more effective in extracting the real case scenarios of the decision problems to add competitive advantages in a supply chain. Group members from wider spectrum of the environment naturally command variation in knowledge level to their respective domain. The degree of heterogeneity of the decision makers in a group plays a crucial role in realistic assessment of both alternatives and selection criteria. This paper proposes a new Multi criteria GDM approach in adroit exploitation of the group heterogeneity during evaluation process and restrict the biasness of information while decision making. The importance of the heterogeneous degree of expertise is established through pair wise preference comparison matrix. To overcome the biasness, the consistency check mechanism of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is employed.

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach to cope with the multi-criteria group decision-making problems. We give the pairwise comparisons based on the best-worst-method (BWM), which can decrease comparison times. Additionally, our comparison results are determined with the positive and negative aspects. In order to deal with the decision matrices effectively, we consider the elimination and choice translation reality (ELECTRE III) method under the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations environment. The ELECTRE III method is designed for a double-automatic system. Under a certain limitation, without bothering the decision-makers to reevaluate the alternatives, this system can adjust some special elements that have the most influence on the group's satisfaction degree. Moreover, the proposed method is suitable for both the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation and the interval valued fuzzy preference relations through the transformation formula. An illustrative example is followed to demonstrate the rationality and availability of the novel method. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In this article we compare five alternative projects for the requalification of an abandoned quarry. The starting point for this paper was a request made by a decision maker. It was not for help in making a decision as such, but rather for a comparison of different projects. In particular, we are interested in ranking the considered projects on the basis of six different criteria. An extension of the Electre III method with interactions between pairs of criteria was applied in the research. A focus group of experts (in economic evaluation, environmental engineering, and landscape ecology) was formed to be in charge of the process leading to the assignment of numerical values to the weights and interaction coefficients. We report on the way the process evolved and on the difficulties we encountered in obtaining consensual sets of values. Taking into account these difficulties, we considered other sets of weights and interaction coefficients. Our aim was also to study the impact on the final ranking of the fact that these numerical values, assigned to the parameters, were not perfectly defined. This allowed us to formulate robust conclusions which were presented to the members of the focus group. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

abstract={This paper proposes a method for ranking a set of alternatives evaluated using multiple and conflicting criteria that are organised in a hierarchical structure. The hierarchy permits the decision maker to identify different intermediate sub-problems of interest. In that way, the analysis of the criteria is done according to the subsets defined in the hierarchy, and following the precedence relations in a bottom-up approach. To deal with this type of hierarchical structures, an extension of the ELECTRE-III method, called ELECTRE-III-H, is presented. As all methods of ELECTRE family, this one also relies on building a binary outranking relation on the set of alternatives on the basis of concordance and discordance tests. The exploitation of this outranking relation generates a partial pre-order, establishing an indifference, preference or incomparability relation for each pair of alternatives. The idea of a bottom-up application of the classical ELECTRE-III method to sub-problems involving subsets of criteria at the intermediate levels of the hierarchy is infeasible because the evaluations of alternatives by criteria aggregating some sub-criteria have the form of partial pre-orders, and not complete pre-orders. Thus, we propose a new procedure for building outranking relations from a set of partial pre-orders, as well as a mechanism for propagating these pre-orders upwards in the hierarchy. With this method, the decision maker is able to analyse the problem in a decomposed way and gain information from the outputs obtained at intermediate levels. In addition, ELECTRE-III-H gives the decision maker the possibility to define a local preference model at each node of the hierarchy, according to his objectives and sub-problem characteristics. We show an application of this method to rank websites of tourist destination brands evaluated using a hierarchy with 4 levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Regarding to the solution space of the problem, for assigning and sequencing operations, a multi-objective genetic algorithm based on the ELECTRE method is presented. Also, a powerful heuristic approach to tradeoff the objective functions is developed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with some well-known multi-objective algorithms such as NSGAII, SPEA2, and VEGA.

abstract={Abstract: Selecting medical equipment is a complex multidisciplinary task requiring mathematical tools, considering associated uncertainties. This paper offers an in-depth study of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to identify the most appropriate ones for performing management tasks in resource-limited settings. The chosen articles were divided into three topics: evaluation of projects and equipment, selection of projects and equipment, and development of medical devices. Three methods (analytic hierarchy process [AHP], multi-attribute utility theory and elimination and choice expressing reality) were selected for detailed analyses of their application for medical equipment management. Twenty-one work using MCDA, artificial neural networks, human factors engineering, and value analysis were analysed in the framework of medical equipment management. The important aspects of the procedure were described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. It was determined that the AHP approach corresponds to all defined criteria for selecting large medical equipment. Managing large medical equipment using MCDA will reduce uncertainties, and provide a rational selection and purchase of the most efficient equipment in resource-limited settings. The direction for improving the AHP method was determined. © 2014, Copyright © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract={With the continuous consumption of fossil energy, the development and utilization of renewable energy with the goal of sustainable development has become more important in China, a large energy-consuming country. The purpose of this article is to develop a new framework to assess the priority of renewable energy development and utilization in China from a sustainable development perspective, thereby contributing to renewable energy management. To determine the weight of each criterion, the network analysis method (ANP) was used to evaluate the importance of each criterion. In addition, multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods such as WSM, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, ELECTRE and VIKOR were used to quantitatively evaluate renewable energy alternatives so that different methods can support each other to make the comprehensive results more convincing. The results show that energy sustainability indicators have the highest priority among all standards. Among renewable energy sources in China, hydropower is the best choice. From a regional perspective, North and Northeast China are biased towards wind power, East and Northwest China are biased towards photovoltaics, and Central South and Southwest China are biased towards hydropower. In the results of two sensitivity analyses, the sensitivity of energy efficiency, energy variability, and economic allocation is relatively high. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multi-criteria group decision-making is a process in which decision makers assess the performance of alternatives on the basis of conflicting criteria to opt the most worthy alternative as solution. TOPSIS and ELECTRE are effective and commonly used methods to solve multiple criteria decision-making problems. The aim of this study is to propose two new models, namely, complex Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (CPF-TOPSIS) method and complex Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE I (CPF-ELECTRE I) method, to tackle multiple criteria group decision-making problems comprising complex Pythagorean fuzzy data. In these methods, we compare complex Pythagorean fuzzy numbers on the basis of their score functions. We use revised closeness index for the ranking of alternatives in CPF-TOPSIS method. In complex Pythagorean fuzzy concordance and discordance sets, we compare the alternatives on being superior and inferior to other alternatives on the basis of score degree, accuracy degree and indeterminacy. In CPF-ELECTRE I method, we use outranking decision graph to obtain the best alternative. We illustrate the structure of both methods with the help of flow charts. To verify the accuracy of proposed methods, we present an explanatory example for selection of best interior designer for a hotel renovation. We authenticate the proposed techniques by providing a brief comparative analysis of these methods with existing methods. © 2020, University of Sistan and Baluchestan. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study analyzes the effect of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) on the efficiency of the end-of-life vehicle (ELV) reverse logistics industry in the context of the circular economy to improve resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, the DEA-TOPSIS method, based on a prediction model of Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES), is adopted for multi-attribute decision making with a view to improving industry efficiency, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the input and output indicators’ efficiency values and the slack movements of the indicators of input and output decision-making unit's (DMU's) base with TES as the decision-making basis. Meanwhile, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is used to rank alternative decision-making schemes. Moreover, the ordering is also carried out using the Additive Weighting, Weighted Product and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method. In this study, the DEA-TOPSIS method is used to make multi-attribute decisions about industry efficiency. Taking Shanghai's ELV industry as an example, this study utilizes 2017 data from seven member-enterprises of the Shanghai End-of-life Vehicle Professional Committee; it uses the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES to conduct an empirical study on multi-attribute decision making to improve efficiency and analyze efficiency improvement through alternative decision-making schemes. The findings show that the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES is effective for multi-attribute decision-making to improve the ELV reverse logistics industry's efficiency. The multi-attribute decision-making in this paper facilitates the management and investment decision making of the ELV recycling industry. It also provides an effective solution for managers and researchers in the ELV industry to improve its efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The virtual business work flow depends on the information quality (IQ) which is essential attribute of information. The IQ depends strongly on organization of the information system (IS) and how the information is processed. In our approach we incorporate the four-aspect representation of IQ: (1) intrinsic, (2) contextual, (3) representational, and (4) accessibility. These four-aspects are divided into several criteria at the next level of hierarchy. The weights, representing the relative importance of criteria, have been assessed by pair-wise comparisons made by group of experts. Based on discussion with experts, six alternative strategies, that could be used for improving the IQ, were designed. For each given criterion, the group of subjects revealed the opinion about the level of achievement of every alternative. The set of scores, assigned to the alternative by different subjects, formed the discrete distribution that is used for a comparison of alternatives with the aid of stochastic dominances. In analogy to the Electre I methodology, the simple algorithm for the aggregate evaluation of analyzed alternatives was proposed. The benefits of proposed approach were demonstrated in a case study of the semiconductor industry. The results of our study suggest, that in case of matured company, the external strategies, that point out to the information exchange and strategic networked alliance with customers and suppliers, are preferred to the internal ones. The latter ones might be of greater importance for the new set up or for a young company. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study proposes a novel decision support system for product ranking problems which integrates multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and aspect level sentiment analysis techniques. The main purpose of the developed methodology is to rank the alternative products taking into account a set of product criteria and the customer comments related to these criteria posted on websites to recommend the most appropriate alternative to potential customers. The decision support system comprises two stages, in the first stage, the online customer reviews are transformed into customer satisfaction scores through aspect level sentiment analysis to obtain performance scores corresponding to alternative products, whereas the second stage deals with ranking the alternative products via a novel MCDM methodology, namely “IF-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR” according to the performance scores obtained in the first level. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are utilized to effectively represent the customer reviews including hesitant expressions in decision matrix. The weights of criteria (the product aspects of significant importance for customers) are determined using entropy method. The applicability of the developed approach is explored by a case study, in which customer reviews about hotel experiences are evaluated using lexicon based sentiment analysis and alternative hotels are ranked according to the findings from the sentiment analysis by the Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF)-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Among the most recent methods in the family, ELECTRE IS, III, and TRI compute fuzzy indices for the credibility of a given action outranking some other. We consider the case when the DMs are unsure which values each parameter should take, which may result from insufficient, imprecise or contradictory information, as well as from different preferences among a group of DMs. In the framework of a robustness analysis approach, where DMs provide only partial information on the parameter values (through constraints on acceptable combinations), we study how to find whether an outranking among two actions in an ELECTRE method is robust. In this context, we study the resulting nonlinear problems of optimizing a credibility index (under the type of constraints that we consider to appear in practice) and present some examples. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Data mining techniques, extracting patterns from large databases are the processes that focus on the automatic exploration and analysis of large quantities of raw data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules. In the process of applying the methods, most of the managers who are engaging the business encounter a multitude of rules resulted from the data mining technique. In view of multi-faceted characteristics of such rules, in general, the rules are featured by multiple conflicting criteria that are directly related with the business values, such as, e.g. expected monetary value or incremental monetary value. In the paper, we present a method for rule prioritization, taking into account the business values which are comprised of objective metric or managers' subjective judgments. The proposed methodology is an attempt to make synergy with decision analysis techniques for solving problems in the domain of data mining. We believe that this approach would be particularly useful for the business managers who are suffering from rule quality or quantity problems, conflicts between extracted rules, and difficulties of building a consensus in case several managers are involved for the rule selection. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Keen competition drives hotel companies to enhance their position. One way to do this is to select a proper hotel location. However, hotel location selection is a complex problem. This study establishes a multi-criteria hotel location selection method. In this method, cognitive information is depicted by multi-hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (MHFLTSs). Moreover, the method considers the non-compensation of criteria. It introduces the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method. Notably, the method utilizes projection to define concordance and discordance indices. A case study and comparative study are performed in this study. They exhibit the feasibility of the method. Results of the studies show that the method can solve such problems, and they reveal the method’s advantages. One theoretical contribution lies in the characterization of cognitive information. MHFLTSs can handle vacillation of decision-makers caused by their complex cognition, and they express both conformity and divergence of opinions during cognitive processes. Our method has the advantages of the ELECTRE method. In addition, the ELECTRE method is improved by introducing the projection. The proposed method is promising in hotel location selection. Moreover, it is a potential option to address cognitive computation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The impact of alternative river basin development strategies is examined from a multicriterion viewpoint using the ELECTRE I and II techniques. The main stem of the Santa Cruz River in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona is taken as a case study. A systematic formulation of the problem is provided leading to an array of 25 alternative systems versus 13 criteria, only 5 of which are quantified. A procedure for ranking these alternatives is presented which uses ELECTRE I to obtain preference graphs as input into ELECTRE II, which is then used to obtain the ordering. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the weights assigned to each criterion has a greater effect on the results than does changing the scales. However, neither effect is very significant. It is recommended that ELECTRE I be used for screening purposes to narrow the set of alternatives under consideration. ELECTRE II can then be applied to this reduced set to obtain a complete ordering. For the case study the preferred systems include reservoirs and channelization and the least preferred systems include new groundwater development. Copyright 1982 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract={In Turkey, current energy generations are not sufficient for the existing energy needs and besides, energy demand is expected to increase by 4-6 percent annually until 2023. Therefore, the government aims to increase the ratio of renewable energy resources (RES) in total installed capacity to 30 percent by 2023. By this date, total energy investments are expected to be approximately $110 billion. Turkey is the fastest growing energy market among the OECD countries. Therefore, Turkey is an attractive market for energy companies and investors. At this stage, site selection and deciding appropriate RES are the most important feasibility parameters for investment. In this study, "Site Selection in Turkey" issue for RES (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass) is evaluated by the ELECTRE which is one of the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. In addition, the reasons for choosing this method are explained according to the literature. The study emphasizes the importance of energy generation from renewable and sustainable sources and is concerned with improving the position of the country. The Turkish government offers many purchasing guarantees and high incentives, especially in the renewable energy sector. As a result of the analysis, the most suitable energy sources are presented according to the geography and energy potential of the regions. The study aims to inform energy firms and everyone related with RES about Turkey's RES opportunities. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques require different levels of computational intensity and may produce different outputs, so selecting an appropriate technique largely determines the quality of the recommended decision and the effort required to obtain that decision. In most real environments, criteria and their constraints are not deterministic and cannot be specified precisely; therefore, those criteria are uncertain or fuzzy. To facilitate the selection of an appropriate MCDM method under a fuzzy environment, this study investigates and statistically compares the performances of ten commonly used MCDM techniques: simple additive weights (SAW), weighted product method (WPM), compromise programming (CP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), four types of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), VIKOR (in Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), and ELECTRE (in French: ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité). These techniques’ performances were compared using fuzzy criteria and constraints, matching the conditions usually found in real applications. To conduct the comparisons, the 10 multi-criteria decision ranking methods were applied to 1250 simulated sets of decision matrices with fuzzy triangular values, and 12,500 sets of ranks were analyzed to compare the ranking methods. SAW and TOPSIS had statistically similar performances. ELECTRE was not preferable in providing full, sorted ranks among the alternatives. VIKOR considering its ranking process, for specific conditions, assigns identical ranks for several alternatives; when full, sorted ranks are required, VIKOR is unfavorable, although it is a powerful technique in introducing the closest alternative to the ideal condition. Types 1 and 3 of AHP and types 2 and 4 of AHP had close performances. Notably, no ranking method was significantly sensitive to uncertainty levels when uncertainty changed symmetrically. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={For municipalities that have joined the Covenant of Mayors promoted by the European Commission, the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) represents a strategic tool for achieving the greenhouse gas reductions required by 2020. So far as the energy retrofit actions in their residential building stock are concerned, which in the small-to-medium municipalities are responsible for more than 60% of CO2 emissions, the scenarios for intervening are normally decided on the basis of an economic (cost/performance) analysis. This type of analysis, however, does not take into account important aspects for small and medium-sized communities such as social aspects, environmental impacts, local economic development and employment. A more comprehensive and effective tool to support the choices of public administrators is the multi-criteria analysis. This study proposes a methodology that integrates multi-criteria analysis in order to support Public Administration/Local Authorities in programming Sustainable Energy Action Plans with a more targeted approach to sustainability. The methodology, based on the ELECTRE III method, was applied to a medium-size municipality in the Lombardy region of Italy. The results obtained with this approach are discussed in this paper. © 2013 by the authors.},

abstract={Construction and demolition waste (C&DW) constitutes a priority waste stream in the European waste strategy due to its large volume and its high recycling and reuse potential. Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, stresses the need of quantify the waste stream and to improve the material recovery efficiency of C&DW in the European Union. Designing a suitable network of facilities involves an adequate knowledge of the inputs to material recovery facilities. In this work, a two-step methodology for the quantification and waste management analysis of C&DW has been developed and applied to the case study in Cantabria, a northern Spanish region. In the first step, the quantification of C&DW was calculated by means of an equation which combines municipal licenses and ratios of waste per unit area of construction, demolition and renovation. The selected ratios for the study case in Cantabria belong to four northern Spanish regions, and they were developed by two associations of architects, one technological institute and by the regional legislation recently developed in the region. In the second step, the waste management assessment for C&DW was carry out throw the development of a multicriteria-based methodology for decision-making in order to select the most suitable management alternative. The application of the methodology to the case study in Cantabria has been performed using four multicriteria analysis methods: Evamix (EV), Weighted Summation (WS), Electre II (E2) and Regime (REG). Analyses of the sensitivity of the results have been also carried out in order to investigate the robustness of the solutions obtained in the decision making process. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract={An annual prize is attributed to the best student's final work by the Belgian Operations Research Society. In 1992, the author happened to be a member of the jury designated by this Society to evaluate the candidates and to elect the best one. The three others members of the jury were kindly convinced by the author to use a multiple criteria and multijudge procedure to discriminate the eight candidates qualities, parallely to their more classical global evaluation. In order to facilitate the procedure, a group decision support system (GDSS) was fed by four evaluation matrices given by the team, who defined a common set of criteria completed by an overall direct evaluation. The purposes of this paper are to describe this real-world experiment and to present a multiple criteria procedure of candidates' selection and ranking supported by the software ARGOS (acronym of aid to the ranking to be made by a group of decision makers using an outranking support). This GDSS allows a team of decision makers to run one or several releases of ELECTRE and PROMETHEE methods of preference aggregation in order to deal with the problems of sorting, ranking and of electing the best candidate. A first release of ARGOS is able to deal with the two phases of a group decision process: the multiple criteria preference aggregation performed by each member of the group in the first phase, and, in the second phase, the comparison of results issued from the application of several functions of social choices for supporting the deliberation process of the group, e.g. Borda or Condorcet functions, the Raynaud's prudent orders and some rank disagreements functions. In its second release, ARGOS has been enriched by the addition of JUDGES, the name for another GDSS which compares the rankings given by the team's members and the candidates' distributions of ranks, provides advices for seeking a consensus, and supports voting simulations. Scope and purpose Multiple criteria literature has a rich history. Outranking approach is a very dynamical branch of this literature with its 'star methods' Electre and Promethee. More and more often, real-world applications of these methods involve small teams of decision makers. Another branch of decision aid is concerned with facilitation of small group meeting in view of ranking projects or candidates, and several softwares have been designed for this purpose. Few of them are focused on the junction of both approaches allowing to deal with outranking in the framework of small team decision making. The purpose of this paper is to present the software ARGOS, which addresses this latter problem through its use in the facilitation of the attribution of a scientific award.

abstract={ELECTRE-I technique is extensively used in real-life applications, but coping with the precise statistics and numerical measure, it is hard to target precisely because the expert’s judgments are mostly vague in practical problems. In this research article, we introduce an m–polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I (mF-ELECTRE-I) approach as a brand new extension of the ELECTRE-I, for multi-criteria decision-making problems based on m–polar fuzzy sets because it is a powerful tool for depicting fuzziness and uncertainty under multipolar information. Proposed technique is more flexible and practical for real-world problems, specially when data come from multipolar information. In the proposed approach, the ratings of the alternatives under subjective criteria and its normalized weights are assessed by the decision maker. We solve numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility, validity and effectiveness of our proposed technique. We also make pairwise comparisons of the alternatives by using outranking relations in numerical examples. Further, we present the rankings of alternatives through a directed graph that shows which alternative is preferable or incomparable under m–polar fuzzy environment. Finally, we develop an algorithm of our proposed approach and compare it with previously existing approaches. © 2019, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association.},

abstract={Due to the increase in trade from Korea to Central Asia, an efficient intermodal route for transporting cargo is important. Intermodal routing for long-distance transportation faces operational challenges, such as customs clearance, track gauge differences, and climate limitations. The initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt recently proposed in China could improve trade and transport links in Asia and create an efficient transportation route that focuses on the railroad service provided in China. The objective of this study is to obtain an evaluation structure for intermodal routing and then find the route for transporting cargo from Korea to Central Asia under China’s Silk Road Economic Belt with integrated Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy (Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) I methods. After a sensitivity analysis is performed, development strategies and alternative routes are suggested. The results show that among the five principal factors, total cost is the most important factor for logistics companies when they select a transportation route, followed by reliability, transportation capability, total time, and security. Of the sub-factor weights, transportation costs and cooperation and emphasis among state organization are important. In the intermodal route results, route 3, Incheon to Qingdao to Horgos to Almaty, is preferred. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Equipment selection is a complex task that requires the consideration of multiple criteria with different measurement units. A number of decision-making methods have been proposed for analysing equipment selection problems, each having their own distinctive advantages and limitations. Despite the number of decision-making techniques available, few comparative studies exist that evaluate two or more methods with a singular problem. This paper evaluates three multi-attribute decision-making methods for an equipment selection problem in the early stages of a chemical manufacturing process. A software framework which incorporates analytical hierarchy process (AHP), multi-attribute range evaluations (MARE) and ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité trois (ELECTRE III) was developed and distributed to a technology manager at Fujifilm Imaging Colorants Ltd (FFIC). The manager, within a team of nine people, examined the same decision problem using the three decision analysis methods. The results of the study are examined in respect to assessing each method’s ability to provide accurate representations of the decision-makers’ preferences and the ability to comprehend the uncertainty present. The decision-makers identified MARE as their preferred method, AHP was found to be comparatively more time-consuming and showed the highest variation of results while ELECTRE III was unable to provide a conclusive best result. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Many companies today have embraced the concept of risk management, usually in the form of enterprise risk management or supply chain risk management. Both are based on a holistic view of risks. Hence, risks related to specific functions within a company must be considered more broadly than previously. Risks, however, involve uncertainty, and the less specific the context in which risks are viewed, the more uncertainty will be involved. One particular way to express uncertainty is through trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). In this paper, risks that are relevant for supplier risk assessments are first collected from the literature. Then it is illustrated how the multi-criteria decision analysis method ELECTRE TRI-C can be used for sorting suppliers into risk categories, when the risks as well as some of the method's parameters are expressed with TrIFNs. In order to do this, we make use of a small modification of an existing method for converting TrIFNs into crisp values. The approach is illustrated in a case problem based on a company that is looking for service providers (suppliers) of electrical maintenance. The problem involves 20 suppliers that are sorted into three risk categories based on evaluations from 27 criteria. Results from the case study point to two low risk suppliers. A further ad-hoc analysis suggests one of these to be less risky than the other. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Decision making is a common process in human activities. Every person or organization needs to make decisions besides dealing with uncertainty and vagueness associated with human cognition. The theory of fuzzy logic provides a mathematical base to model the uncertainities. Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) creates an appropriate method to deal with uncertainty in decision making. Managerial decision making generally implies that decision making process conducts multiple and conflicting criteria. Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a widely applied decision making method. Outranking methods are one type of MCDA methods which facilitate the decision making process through comparing binary relations in order to rank the alternatives. Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Réalité (ELECTRE), means elimination and choice that translates reality, is an outranking method. In this paper, an extended version of ELECTRE I method using HFLTS is proposed. Finally, a real case problem is provided to illustrate the HFLTS-ELECTRE I method. © 2016 the authors.},

abstract={More and more groundwater has been polluted recently, and technologies for groundwater contamination remediation are of vital importance; however, it is usually difficult for the users to select the most suitable technology among multiple alternatives. In order to address this, this study aims at developing a sustainability assessment framework for prioritizing the technologies for groundwater contamination remediation by combining the concept of sustainability and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. A criterion system which consists of six criteria in three aspects has been proposed for sustainability assessment of technologies for groundwater contamination remediation, and a novel MCDM method by combining the logarithmic fuzzy preference programming based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the improved ELECTRE method has been developed for prioritizing the alternatives. In order to illustrate the developed methodology, four technologies including pump-treat (P&T), monitored natural attenuation (MNA), permeable reactive barriers (PRB), and air sparging (AS) have been studied, and the results show that the proposed methodology is feasible for prioritizing the technologies for groundwater contamination remediation for the stakeholders/decision-makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the computational phase allowed for testing the above mentioned multiple criteria ranking methods, i. e.: AHP and ELECTRE III/IV and analyzing their suitability for performing a multiple level, multiple criteria evaluation of transportation projects.

abstract={Many decision problems in real-world deal with conflicting criteria, uncertainty and imprecise information. Some also allow a group of decision makers (DMs) to make their opinions independently. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a well known decision method that can make the quality of group multiple criteria decisions better by creating a more explicit, rational and efficient process. A group of MCDM models known as "outranking methods" have been used to rank a set of alternatives. ELECTRE I is an outranking method which is simple, but provides partial ranking. So we consider VIKOR and try to mitigate this problem with regard to relations between VIKOR and ELECTRE. The objective of this paper is to extend ELECTRE I method based on VIKOR to rank a set of alternatives versus a set of criteria to show the decision maker's preferences. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Multiple criteria sorting aims at assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria to predefined ordered categories. In this paper, we consider a well known multiple criteria sorting method, Electre Tri, which involves three types of preference parameters: (1) category limits defining the frontiers between consecutive categories, (2) weights and majority level specifying which coalitions form a majority, and (3) veto thresholds characterizing discordance effects. We propose an elicitation procedure to infer category limits from assignment examples provided by multiple decision makers. The procedure computes a set of category limits and vetoes common to all decision makers, with variable weights for each decision maker. Hence, the method helps reaching a consensus among decision makers on the category limits and veto thresholds, whereas finding a consensus on weights is left aside. The inference procedure is based on mixed integer linear programming and performs well even for datasets corresponding to real-world decision problems. We provide an illustrative example of the use of the method and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the forthcoming heterogeneous wireless environment, the mobility management of users roaming between different wireless access technologies is a challenging and important technical issue. New mobile devices such as netbooks, smartphones and tablets allow users to perform vertical handoffs among different wireless networks. The multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods are suitable tools to model and study the vertical handoff process. Hence, recently several MADM methods such as SAW, MEW, TOPSIS, GRA, ELECTRE, VIKOR and WMC have been proposed for vertical handoff. In this paper, we present an extensive performance evaluation and comparative study of the seven MAMD methods by means of numerical simulations in MATLAB. We evaluate the performance of each vertical handoff method under different applications such as voice, data, and cost-constrained connections. We also perform a sensitivity analysis and evaluate the computational complexity of each method in terms of number of floating point operations.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to generalize the way of computing the credibility of outranking in a multiple criteria aggregation procedure, in view of taking into account two new effects called reinforced preference and counter-veto. These effects concern only those criteria for which, as soon as action a is "judged very strongly preferred" to action b, one wishes that the credibility of outranking of a over b is greater than that for the case where (all things equal elsewhere) the preference is not "judged very strong". To achieve this goal, we propose two complementary ways. The first one involves a reinforced preference threshold which affects the concordance degree, and the second one involves a counter-veto threshold which affects the insertion of discordance degree in the calculation of the credibility of outranking. The introduction of these two new effects remains compatible with the handling of ordinal preference scales. The resulting new index of the credibility of outranking can be used, in particular, in ELECTRE methods. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Traditionally, in the literature on the modelling of decision aids one notes the propensity to treat expected utility models and outranking relation models as rivals. It may be possible, however, to benefit from the use of both approaches in a risky decision context. Stochastic dominance conditions can be used to establish, for each criterion, the preferences of a decision maker and to characterise them by a concave or convex utility function. Two levels of complexity in preference elicitation, designated as clear and unclear, are distinguished. Only in the case of unclear preferences is it potentially interesting to attempt to estimate the value function of the decision maker, thus obtaining his (her) preferences with a reduced number of questions. The number of questions that must be asked of the decision maker depends upon the level of the concordance threshold that he(she) requires in the construction of the outranking relations using the ELECTRE method. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={The application of multiobjective solution techniques requires, at some point in the analysis, the specification of the preference structure of the decision maker over the set of objectives. In practice, this step must often take the form of determining a set of weights that attempts to quantify the relative importance of the various competing objectives. This paper looks at how some of the well known techniques make use of these weights in attempting to achieve the best compromise solution. The definition of the weights (i.e., what meaning they carry into the analysis) is also explored. It is found that one must be very careful about applying weights when using these techniques. A different set of weights for the same objectives may apply when implementing two different techniques. In addition, a related factor, the specification of scales or ranges over which the objectives are to be evaluated, is explored. Again, it is found that different techniques use these scales in ways that change the manner in which they should be defined. The techniques reviewed are compromise programming, multiattribute utility theory, ELECTRE and cooperative game theory. Concepts are illustrated through the use of a water resources example problem. © 1984.},

This paper aims to evaluate the cleaner production for gold mines by exploring applicable decision making methods. First, the picture fuzzy numbers with four membership degrees are adopted to describe experts' assessment information under complicated fuzzy environment. Thereafter, the extended stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis and mean-squared deviation models are combined to obtain the comprehensive criteria weights. Meanwhile, a novel evaluation method, which integrates the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) with elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) module, is proposed to judge the cleaner production level. Subsequently, according to the characteristics of gold mines, an evaluation criteria system of cleaner production is constructed. Finally, a case of evaluating the cleaner production performance for four gold mines is provided to explain the application of the proposed method. Besides, a systematic comparison analysis with other existent methods is conducted to reveal the advantages of our method. Results indicate that the integrated EDAS-ELECTRE method is suitable and effective for gold mines to evaluate their cleaner production performance, and has important reference values for the cleaner production management and implementation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={We have investigated business failure prediction (BFP) by a combination of decision-aid, statistical, and artificial intelligence techniques. The goal is to construct a hybrid forecasting method for BFP by combining various outranking preference functions with case-based reasoning (CBR), whose heart is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, and to empirically test the predictive performance of its modules. The hybrid2 CBR (H2CBR) forecasting method was constructed by integrating six hybrid CBR modules. These hybrid CBR modules were built up by combining and modifying six outranking preference functions with the algorithm of k-NN inside CBR. A trial-and-error iterative process was employed to identify the optimal hybrid CBR module of the H2CBR forecasting system. The prediction of the optimal module is the final output of the H2CBR forecasting method. We have compared the predictive performance of the six hybrid CBR modules in BFP of Chinese listed companies. In this empirical study, the classical CBR algorithm based on the Euclidean metric, and the two classical statistical methods of logistic regression (Logit) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) were used as baseline models for comparison. Feature subsets were selected with the stepwise method of MDA. The predictive performance of the H2CBR system is promising; the most preferred hybrid CBR for short-term BFP of Chinese listed companies is based on the ranking-order preference function. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Planning, construction and operation of transport infrastructure are associated with a multitude of adverse effects on the environment. The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are important legal instruments of the European Union's environmental policy that allows for identifying, predicting, preventing, and mitigating and or compensating for these adverse effects. As part of the environmental impact assessment, variants of planned activities and investment projects are considered in order to select the option, which is the most favourable from the environmental point of view. The primary goal of this work is to examine the possibility of using multi-criteria methods in order to select the route variant most favourable for the environment. In the first stage, a review of global literature from 2010 to 2019 was conducted on the subject of MCDM/MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Making/Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) methods used in transportation. Based on the review, it was proven that the most popular methods used to solve multi-criteria decision problems in the field of transport are respectively: AHP with modifications, TOPSIS, DEMATEL, as well as methods encompassed in the so-called European trend, i.e. PROMETHEE and ELECTRE. Four selected methods were used in the empirical part of this work. They were used to select the variant of the expressway section in north-eastern Poland and compare the result of the analysis with the choice made in the analyzed environmental impact report. © 2020},

abstract={Medical diagnosis is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person’s symptoms or signs. The complexity and uncertainty of diagnostic information make the diagnostic process difficult to accomplish. Many theories concerned with medical diagnosis such as fuzzy set theory, rough set theory and soft set theory are presented in the past. We are concerned with bipolar fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The main purpose is to provide guidance for determining a patient’s health status and evaluating the factors influencing that status in bipolar fuzzy environment. Bipolar fuzzy set theory offers a useful tool for developing knowledge-based systems in MCDM methods. Since the diagnosis of an appropriate disease involves bipolar judgement, we utilize bipolar fuzzy Technique for the Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and YinYang bipolar fuzzy Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) in medical diagnosis, where the various diseases for various symptoms and weights of various symptoms are assessed using bipolar fuzzy information and fuzzy information, respectively. Comparison of BF-TOPSIS and BF-ELECTRE-I is presented. The illustrated methods demonstrate the practicability, feasibility and sustainability of diagnostic process. BF-TOPSIS gives one diseases as diagnosis, whereas BF-ELECTRE-I gives the set of diseases as diagnosis. Moreover, the comparison analysis demonstrates which diagnostic process is more credible and accurate. This article presents two powerful MCDM techniques for the diagnosis of a disease in which the pairwise comparison of diseases and symptoms is considered in bipolar behavior. © 2019, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

abstract={A few years ago became notorious the inclusion of environmental and social issues in economic decisions, which led to a new strategic framework for organizations. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to know the present limitations and new paradigms in the operational and tactical developing of organizations, aiming at less striking and balanced actions. Thus, the objective was to develop an integrated interpretation of economic, environmental and social issues of the main companies in the oil and gas sectors in the world, featuring their activities through sustainability indicators covered in the three pillars of development (Triple Bottom Line). For the research robustness the decision support multicriteria analysis (AMD) was used as methodology, which in the application of the method ELECTRE III was possible to verify the ranking of companies according to direct sustainable reports. It was concluded that sustainable strategies allied to the Triple Bottom Line are a corporate and operational differential. Thus, it is expected to contribute to the deepening of enterprise policies across all strategic decisions focused on sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Supplier selection and evaluation is a crucial decision-making issue to establish an effective supply chain. Higher-order fuzzy decision-making methods have become powerful tools to support decision-makers in solving their problems effectively by reflecting uncertainty in calculations better than crisp sets in the last 3 decades. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) sets which are the general form of both intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets, have been recently introduced to provide decision-makers more freedom of expression than other fuzzy sets. In this paper, we introduce q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE as two separate methods and new approaches for group decision making to select the best supplier. As the existing distance measures in q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment have some drawbacks and generate counter-intuitive results, we propose a new distance measure along with its proofs to use in both q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods. Moreover, a comparison study is conducted to illustrate the superiority of the proposed distance measure. Subsequently, a comprehensive case study is performed with q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods separately to choose the best supplier for a construction company by rating the importance of criteria and alternatives under q-ROF environment. Finally, a comparison and parameter analysis are performed among the proposed q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods and existing q-ROF decision-making methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this research paper, we define and test an ELECTRE III-based approach to the construction of non-compensatory composite indicators; these indicators are used for the evaluation of environmental and social performances of urban and regional planning policies. We tested the methodology for the construction of the Land-Use Policy Efficiency Index (LUPEI) on the municipal scale applied to a sample of municipalities in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Based on the literature review concerning composite indicators, we found that linear aggregation rules are the most widely applied aggregation procedures for composite indicators. However, their applicability depends on a set of strong theoretical and operational conditions. If these conditions do not hold, then other aggregation and weighting procedures must be applied to construct the composite indicators. We tested the ELECTRE III via a fruitful interaction with three experts who were participating in a focus group. We found that composite indicators are powerful tools when it comes to the assessment of multidimensional planning issues. Since each sub-indicator provides different information and responds to different goals, rankings and assessment based on mono-indicator frameworks can lead to incomplete or even biased results that do not consider an integrated approach to land-use policy efficiency. Moreover, both experts and decision-makers appreciated the role of composite indicators in increasing knowledge and providing deeper insights into complex phenomena in the domains of urban and regional planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection of material for a specific engineering component, which plays a significant role in its design and proper functioning, is often treated as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem where the most suitable material is to be chosen based on a given set of conflicting criteria. For solving these MCDM problems, the designers do not generally know what should be the optimal number of criteria required for arriving at the best decisive action. Those criteria should be independent to each other and their number should usually limit to seven plus or minus two. In this paper, five material selection problems are solved using three common MCDM techniques to demonstrate the effect of number of criteria on the final rankings of the material alternatives. It is interesting to observe that the choices of the best suited materials solely depend on the criterion having the maximum priority value. It is also found that among the three MCDM methods, the ranking performance of VIKOR (Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) method is the best. © 2013 Growing Science Ltd.

This paper, using a sample case study within an organization, shows how different versions of ELECTRE methods can be used in choosing efficient strategies that account for both human behavioral resistance and technical elements. The effect of resistance from each subsystem of the organization is studied to ensure the reliability of the chosen strategy. The comparison of results from a select number of compensatory and noncompensatory models (ELECTRE I, III, IV, IS; TOPSIS; SAW; MaxMin) suggests that when employee resistance is a decision factor in the multicriteria strategic planning problem, the models can yield low-resistance strategies; however, ELECTRE seems to show more reasonable sensitivity.},

abstract={The concept of network virtualization has attracted significant attention from academia to industry. One of the key challenges in network virtualization is the resource allocation problem, which is also termed the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. It involved with mapping virtual networks onto a substrate network by adhering to some constraints, such as CPU capacity, on the nodes and bandwidth resources on the links. However, prior heuristic VNE algorithms mostly concentrate on measuring the embedding potential of substrate nodes using the multiplication of different nodes' resource metrics. Due to the fact that different resource metrics have different impacts on node ranking, these traditional methods have some limitations that would cause unbalanced embedding problems. Furthermore, the number of hops for the substrate paths that virtual links are mapped onto will have a large impact on the resource utilization of substrate links in a substrate network. In this paper, based on the topology analysis of six situations, we first propose a novel five-node ranking metric to quantify the importance of substrate nodes. Then, we give a comprehensive measurement method for substrate nodes using the simplified ELECTRE method to avoid an unbalanced embedding solution. We present a novel two-stage VNE algorithm, which chooses the substrate nodes with the maximum embedding potential to perform the node mapping procedure, and uses the shortest path algorithm to accomplish the link mapping procedure. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that our proposed method behaves better than the other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the long-term average revenue, the revenue-to-cost (R/C) ratio, and the VN request acceptance ratio. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation is of vital importance for helping the decision-makers to select the most sustainable technology among multiple alternatives. This paper aims at developing an innovative methodology for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. A total of eight criteria have been used for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation in this study, and they are capital cost, detection and analysis costs, and operation and maintenance costs in economic aspects, effect of secondary pollution environmental aspect, effectiveness for water quality improvement and time for remediation in technological aspect, the effect on public health in social aspect, and policy support belonging to political aspect. The relative priorities of the alternative technologies with respect to each criterion were scored by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and it was also employed to calculate the weights of the criteria. After determining the decision-making matrix,ELECTRE was employed to rank the alternatives according to their sustainability performances. An illustrative case has been studied by the proposed method, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has been recognized as the most sustainable technology for groundwater remediation, followed by pump-treat (P&T) technology, permeable reactive barriers (PRB) and air sparing (AS). Finally, Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the robustness of the results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Industrial decision-makers often try to develop new products by reusing their past experience. Methods for obtaining feedback are available in knowledge management and produce tangible results in the industrial world. Nowadays, companies often consider employees' knowledge as an asset. This approach is a potential answer for reusing knowledge acquired through experience. The Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methodology, based on cognitive sciences, consists in solving new problems by reusing past experience. Case-Based Reasoning is an approach to solving a new problem by remembering and adapting a previous successful similar situation to the problem at hand. Of the four activities comprising CBR - Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain-this paper deals with the "Retrieve" phase. Consequently, we suggest using the Multi-Criteria Decisions concept in problem description to search for the solution in a case-based scenario. We show that Multi-Criteria Decisions and Case-Based Reasoning are complementary. This paper proposes using knowledge acquisition as a basis for seeking solutions from non-compensatory multi-criteria decision aids such as the ELECTRE-I and ELECTRE-II methods. We also carry out a robustness analysis at the end of this paper. We describe an industrial application with wire forming machines as an illustration of our recommendation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This need arises from the problem observed in developing countries of a growing demand for water supply projects coupled with a lack of financial resources available to invest in them. A second problem is the selection of a locality that is most in need of assistance for the implementation of the water supply system. This study describes the application of multicriteria decision aid for choosing the priority city to receive a water supply system, using the ELECTRE methodology. It was found that this type of methodology accommodates the decision-making in selecting a locality, with the capacity to integrate weighted qualitative judgment criteria, incorporating the concordance and discordance indices, specifying an efficient allocation of resources available and thus maximising gains.},

abstract={This article proposes two novel modified techniques, namely Pythagorean fuzzy hybrid Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (PFH-TOPSIS) method and Pythagorean fuzzy hybrid ELimination and Choice Translating REality I (PFH-ELECTRE I) method, in order to measure risk rankings in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). These methods are designed to overcome the flaws and shortcomings of traditional crisp risk priority numbers and fuzzy FMEA techniques in risk rankings. The proposed methods consider subjective as well as objective weight values of all factors in risk rankings of identified failures. The FMEA experts team are allowed to submit their information by linguistic terms using Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. Both techniques use a Pythagorean fuzzy weighted averaging operator to aggregate their independent evaluations into group assessments. Subsequent steps are different. The PFH-TOPSIS approach computes the distances of failure modes from the Pythagorean fuzzy positive ideal solution and Pythagorean fuzzy negative ideal solution. To evaluate failure modes, the PFH-ELECTRE I approach produces Pythagorean fuzzy concordance and Pythagorean fuzzy discordance matrices. We illustrate the structure of both techniques with the help of flowcharts. The effectiveness of the methods that we develop is described by a numerical example, namely a case study of 1.8-in. color super-twisted nematic (CSTN). To validate their effectiveness and accuracy, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis with existing techniques of risk evaluation, including intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid TOPSIS, intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS, IWF-TOPSIS, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

For this purpose, five different healthcare waste treatment/disposal alternatives including incineration, microwaving, on-site sterilization, off-site sterilization and landfill were evaluated according to two multi-criteria decision-making techniques: analytic network process (ANP) and ELECTRE. In this context, benefits, costs and risks for the alternatives were taken into consideration. Furthermore, the prioritization and ranking of the alternatives were determined and compared for both methods. According to the comparisons, the off-site sterilization technique was found to be the most appropriate solution in both cases. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={Due to its complex, time-demanding, and multifaceted structure, personnel selection is considered as a multicriteria decision-making problem, the framework of which includes both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Although various techniques have been proposed to address this problem in various industries, a robust methodology that is capable of explicitly considering the presence of uncertainty/vagueness is still a necessity. Therefore, with this study, we propose an integrated methodology that leverages Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE) methods under Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF) environment. Within the proposed methodology, firstly, the IF-DEMATEL method is employed to obtain the importance-weights of the elicited criteria, and then the IF-ELECTRE method is formulated and applied to rank the candidates based on cardinal and ordinal evaluations. To illustrate the viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed at an air-filter manufacturing company. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the theoretical and practical extent of the related literature by proposing and illustrating an integrated analytics methodology capable of addressing personnel selection decisions in complex and imprecise real-world scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Major infrastructure and construction (MIC) projects are those with significant traffic or environmental impact, of strategic and regional significance and high sensitivity. The decision-making process of schemes of this type is becoming ever more complicated, especially with the increasing number of stakeholders involved and their growing tendency to defend their own varied interests. Failing to address and meet the concerns and expectations of stakeholders may result in project failures. To avoid this necessitates a systematic participatory approach to facilitate decision making. Though numerous decision models have been established in previous studies (e.g., ELECTRE methods, the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process) their applicability in the decision process during stakeholder participation in contemporary MIC projects is still uncertain. To resolve this, the decision rule approach is employed for modeling multi-stakeholder multi-objective project decisions. Through this, the result is obtained naturally according to the rules accepted by any stakeholder involved. In this sense, consensus is more likely to be achieved because the process is more convincing and the result is more easily accepted by all concerned. Appropriate rules, comprehensive enough to address multiple objectives while straightforward enough to be understood by multiple stakeholders, are set for resolving conflict and facilitating consensus during the project decision process. The West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) project is used as a demonstration case and a focus group meeting is conducted in order to confirm the validity of the model established. The results indicate that the model is objective, reliable and practical enough to cope with real world problems. Finally, a suggested future research agenda is provided. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The focuses of green supplier selection are on considering environmental criteria and strengthening the competitiveness of the entire supply chain. The purpose of this study is to develop a green supplier selection procedure for the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) industry using polarizer suppliers as an example. First, a decision framework for green supplier selection is developed based on literatures and the supplier audit forms provided by an anonymous flat panel display manufacturer in Taiwan. Then, a hybrid multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method is proposed based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III), and the linear assignment method to assist the manufacturer in choosing among four polarizer suppliers. The final ranking results for green supplier selection and different opinions from each department are provided. An improvement report is suggested to enhance suppliers' performance. For the evaluation procedure, most managers emphasize the importance of current capability and the capability of research and development. Furthermore, we found that the subsidiary supplier should improve quality control competence immediately to be considered as the potential candidate of primary supplier. © 2014 Che-Wei Tsui and Ue-Pyng Wen.},

abstract={The assessment of the environmental sustainability of agricultural infrastructures involves the use of multiple evaluation criteria and the analysis of geographical information. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system capable of assembling, storing, analysing, and displaying geographically referenced information. However, the GIS technology still suffers from several shortcomings due in large part to a lack of capable analytical capacity of supporting spatial decision problems. The most common solution for GIS to evolve into an effective tool for decision support is to couple them with operational research tools and in particular Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA). Due to the technological advances in the field of information systems, there is a great need to research how to integrate GIS, MCDA, the Internet, modeling and databases aiming at creating Web Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (Web MC-SDSSs). A Web MC-SDSS methodological framework is proposed for a fully integrated system of GIS and a specific MCDA method - ELECTRE TRI, through the construction of a Macro written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in ArcGIS software. This macro interacts with a Web Algorithm Server for computing MCDA results. The developed Web MC-SDSS, named ELECTRE TRI in ArcGIS, is applied on a case study analysing the environmental sustainability of dairy farms in the Entre-Douro-e-Minho (EDM) Region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work presents a methodology to perform a multi-criteria decision analysis based on qualitative assessments from multiple experts or stakeholders. The application that motivated these methodological developments is also described, consisting of an assessment of policies to foster technological innovations in the electricity sector, namely in a context of evolution to smart grids. Qualitative assessments were elicited from 28 experts using a Delphi process. The assessments concern the impact of policies on different objectives, but also opinions concerning the importance of these objectives. These opinions are translated into constraints on the weights of the corresponding criteria, in a partial information setting. Then, policies are sorted into categories based on a stochastic multi-criteria analysis for the ELECTRE TRI method. A new ranking approach is also developed to be compatible with the sorting results, based on a robustness analysis of ELECTRE TRI credibility indices. Results are discussed considering the entire set of experts and considering subsets of experts representing different perspectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An outranking method is developed within the environment of hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic term sets (HIFLTSs), where the membership degree and the non-membership degree of the element are subsets of linguistic term set. The directional Hausdorff distance, which uses HIFLTSs, is proposed, and the dominance relations are subsequently defined using this distance. Moreover, some interesting characteristics of the proposed directional Hausdorff distance are further discussed in detail. In this context, a collective decision matrix is obtained in the form of hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic elements and analyzes the collective data by using proposed ELECTRE-based outranking method. The linguistic scale functions are employed in this paper to conduct the transformation between qualitative information and quantitative data. Furthermore, based on the proposed method, we also investigate the ranking of the alternatives based on a new proposed definition of HIFLTS. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated with an example, and a comparative analysis is performed with other approaches to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2017, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This work addresses the problem of single robot coverage and exploration in an environment with the goal of finding a specific object previously known to the robot. As limited time is a constraint of interest we cannot search from an infinite number of points. Thus, we propose a multi-objective approach for such search tasks in which we first search for a good set of positions to place the robot sensors in order to acquire information from the environment and to locate the desired object. Given the interesting properties of the Generalized Voronoi Diagram, we restrict the candidate search points along this roadmap. We redefine the problem of finding these search points as a multi-objective optimization one. NSGA-II is used as the search engine and ELECTRE I is applied as a decision making tool to decide among the trade-off alternatives. We also solve a Chinese Postman Problem to optimize the path followed by the robot in order to visit the computed search points. Simulation results show a comparison between the solution found by our method and solutions defined by other known approaches. Finally, a real robot experiment indicates the applicability of our method in practical scenarios. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We introduce an integrated framework for preference modeling and robustness analysis in outranking-based multiple criteria sorting. The preference information supplied by the Decision Maker (DM) is composed of parts of desired recommendation and imprecise requirements that the delivered outcomes should satisfy. Its allowed forms are: Imprecise assignment examples, desired class cardinalities, and assignment-based pairwise comparisons. The exploitation of all instances of the outranking model compatible with these preferences results in three types of outcomes. These raise robustness concerns in terms of the stability of a suggested assignment for each alternative, an observed size of each class, and a comparison between recommendation delivered for pairs of alternatives. The correspondence between different types of inputs and outputs facilitates the dialogue with the DM and enhances her/his confidence in the suggested recommendation. While referring only to a semantic meaning of an outranking relation, we present the procedures for translating the preference information into parameters of compatible outranking model instances and for deriving various kinds of sorting results. Then, we implement this general framework in the context of outranking models specific for ELECTRE and PROMETHEE. Finally, we show how preference modeling and robustness analysis can be performed and greatly simplified with a set of preference model instances providing precise assignments for the alternatives. The framework proposed for this case is based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), being independent of the underlying model and method. Application of the approaches is demonstrated on the case of classifying Polish research units into four quality classes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In contrast to conventional multi-criteria decision aids, such as the well known PROMETHEE approach, AHP or the different versions of ELECTRE, we support the basic assumption of environmetrics: let first the data speak, and then let us include subjective preferences in order to get a unique decision. In the present paper we introduce and discuss the decision support system METEOR (Method of Evaluation by Order Theory). The basis of the method is a data matrix. The rows are defined by the objects which are to be evaluated; the columns are defined by the attributes, which characterize the objects with respect to the evaluation problem. By means of the attributes a partial order is derived. In subsequent steps attributes are aggregated by a weighting procedure, allowing a high degree of participation of stakeholders and other participants of the planning process. The aim is to enrich the partial order stepwise, until the objects of interest can be compared. The software WHASSE written in Delphi is available for scientific purposes from the first author. As an example we evaluate 12 high production volume chemicals (HPVC) which have been detected in the environment by four attributes and discuss the enriched partial order after introducing some weights. It turns out that in some cases the weights have almost no influence concerning the evaluation result, whereas in some other cases slight variations of weights drastically change the evaluation result. Therefore, the metric space spanned by weights can be partitioned in so-called "stability fields" where the evaluation result is invariant and in so-called "hot spots", where the evaluation is strongly changing. This characterisation of the space of weights is helpful for stakeholders to express their preferences. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The selection of a proper physician in a network environment is an important event for most patients, and single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) can depict the uncertainty and fuzziness of online evaluation information for physicians. In addition, the psychological behavior of patients is a significant factor that influences physician selection. This paper proposes two multi-attribute decision-making methods based on prospect theory (PT) with single-valued neutrosophic information and utilizes them to solve physician selection problems. Firstly, a new distance measure for SVNSs is developed to overcome the drawbacks of existing distance measures. Secondly, we develop extended TODIM and extended ELECTRE III approaches based on PT and new distance. We utilize the two proposed approaches to handle a physician selection case that uses data from Vitals.com. Parameter sensitivity and comparative analyses of the proposed methods are presented. Findings indicate that the two proposed methods can yield reasonable and credible solutions. With complementary advantages, the two methods are flexible for patients with various behavior preferences to select and use. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Coal-To-Methanol is a key component in the coal chemical industry and methanol production, as well as large source of pollutants, mainly Chemical Oxygen Demand and Sulphur Dioxide. As a general technique and basis of follow-up processes in the coal chemical industry, selection and assessment of coal gasification techniques plays a crucial role in pollution control and cleaner production. This study explores the best available techniques for cleaner coal gasification production based on the ELECTRE-II method - a widely-used outranking method for multi-criteria decision making. Taking technical features, applicability, environmental and economic benefits into consideration, Gaskombinat Schwarze Pumpe, Shell, opposed multiple burner, Texaco, and atmospheric gasification were selected as the best available techniques from 10 coal gasification techniques. Based on these results, newly-built large-scale Coal-To-Methanol enterprises should select Gaskombinat Schwarze Pumpe. Medium-scale and non-recurring investment limited enterprises should adopt opposed multiple burner or Texaco. Shell is recommended for use in urban gas and thermal power plants. For former small-scale fixed-bed Coal-To-Methanol (or polygeneration) enterprises, atmospheric gasification is recommended to transform conditional fixed-bed gasification technologies. We conclude that the ELECTRE-II method is suitable for assessing coal gasification techniques and identify mature, environmental-friendly, and well-adaptable coal techniques with low construction investment, low running costs, intensive capacity of single-furnace gasification and high automation as best available techniques. This study provides a scientific reference for enterprise managers to choose appropriate coal-to-methanol techniques. Moreover, the introduced index system and the detailed procedure for selecting best available techniques serve as a basis for policy-making about the best available techniques in the coal chemical industry and other industries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The regional water allocation planning is one of those complex decision problems where holistic approach to water supply management considering different criteria would be valuable. However, multi-criteria decision making with diverse indicators measured on different scales and uncertainty levels is difficult to solve. Objective of this paper is to develop scenarios for the future imbalances in water supply and demand for a water stressed Mediterranean area of Northern Spain (Tarragona) and to test the applicability and suitability of an outranking method ELECTRE-III-H for evaluating sectoral water allocation policies. This study is focused on the use of alternative water supply scenarios to fulfil the demand of water from three major sectors: domestic, industrial and agricultural. A detail scenario planning for regional water demand and supply has been discussed. For each future scenario of climate change, the goal is to obtain a ranking of a set of possible actions with regards to different types of indicators (costs, water stress and environmental impact). The analytical method used is based on outranking models for decision aid with hierarchical structures of criteria and ranking alternatives using partial preorders based on pairwise preference relations. We compare several adaptation measures including alternative water sources (reclaimed water and desalination); inter basin water transfer and sectoral demand management coming from industry, agriculture and domestic sectors and tested the sustainability of management actions for different climate change scenarios. Results have shown use of alternative water resources as the most reliable alternative with medium reclaimed water reuse in industry and agriculture and low to medium use of desalination water in domestic and industrial sectors as the best alternative. The proposed method has several advantages such as the management of heterogeneous scales of measurement without requiring any artificial transformation and the management of uncertainty by means of comparisons at a qualitative level in terms of the decision maker preferences. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The selection of optimum aroma among vanilla, strawberry and cacao for prebiotic pudding was aimed based on sensory analyses by performing multi-criteria decision techniques [analytic hierarchy process (AHP), simple additive weighting (SAW), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and elimination et choix traduisant la realite-elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE)]. In the first part of the study, the physicochemical (pH, viscosity, dry matter and ash content) and functional properties (bulk density, water-holding capacity and oil-holding capacity) of the dietary fibres (lemon, inulin, apple and wheat) were determined. According to our results, there are significant differences between the fibres (P < 0.05). In the second part of the study, the INU/OLI dietary fibre was added to the different flavoured pudding samples (cacao, strawberry and vanilla). Some of their physicochemical (bulk density, dry matter and viscosity) and sensorial properties (appearance, consistency of appearance, consistency in the mouth, taste and smell, adhesiveness and general acceptability) were identified. In the last part of the study, multi-criteria decision techniques (AHP, SAW, ELECTRE and TOPSIS) were applied to obtain the ranking of the pudding samples based on the sensorial scores. According to the results of this study, strawberry-flavoured pudding (not including fibre) was mostly preferred. By considering the ranking of the puddings, it was seen that strawberry flavour was the most appropriate for prebiotic pudding. As a result of this study, it was found that multi-criteria decision techniques may be performed to sensorial scores in the food industry to reduce many results to one result thus facilitating the comparison of samples and the explication of results obtained from sensory analysis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Selecting projects is often a difficult task. It is complicated because there is usually more than one dimension for measuring the impact of each project, especially when there is more than one decision maker. This paper is aimed to present the fuzzy ELECTRE approach for prioritizing the most effective projects to improve decision making. To begin with, the ELECTRE is one of most extensively used methods to solve multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The ELECTRE evaluation method is widely recognized for high-performance policy analysis involving both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In this paper, we consider a real application of project selection using the opinion of experts to be applied into a model by one of the group decision makers, called the fuzzy ELECTRE method. A numerical example for project selection is given to clarify the main developed result in this paper. © 2012 Babak Daneshvar Rouyendegh and Serpil Erol.},

abstract={Difficulties related to the group decision-making process in the water supply sector, such as physical and economic losses, irrational use of water and maintenance costs, highlight the need to develop procedures to support decisions, reducing unnecessary water use and wastage. This study focused on the rational use of water resources and reduction of water losses, based on the assumption that it is far more economical to develop and improve existing systems rather than build new systems in parallel to the existing one. This study aimed to support a group decision-making process in the maintenance section of a water supply company. A model is proposed consisting of 2 phases, which aggregates individual preferences to achieve a group decision. The first phase is based on the ELECTRE II method, analysing individual preferences, while the second is based on the COPELAND method to aggregate individual preferences. From this model, we developed a software program to prioritise alternatives, simultaneously taking into account subjective and objective criteria, and thereby giving decision makers a clear and comprehensive overview of alternatives, indicating the most suitable alternative based on the preferences of group members from different areas.},

abstract={We consider the problem of assigning alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories C1, C2,..., C p. This problem is known as the multi-criteria sorting problem and arises in many situations such as classifying countries into different risk levels based on economical and socio-political criteria, evaluating credit applications of bank customers. We are interested in sorting methods that are grounded on the construction of outranking relations. Among these, the Electre Tri method requires defining multidimensional profiles that represent the "frontier" separating consecutive categories Ch and C h+1, and assigns an alternative to categories according to how it compares to each of the profiles. The explicit specification of the profiles of consecutive categories can be difficult for decision makers. We develop a new outranking based sorting method that does not require the explicit definition of profiles. We instead require the decision maker to assign a subset of reference alternatives to the categories. To assign the remaining alternatives, each such alternative is compared to reference alternatives, and assigned to categories accordingly. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A significant part of the research conducted in this field focused on the development of analytical models that can be used in evaluating the alternative ways of action in financial and banking problems. Typically, this evaluation involves the choice of the best alternative, the ranking of the alternatives from the best to the worst ones, or their classification into predefined homogenous classes. This paper is focused on the classification approach illustrating the use of multi–criteria decision aid (MCDA) classification methods in making financial and banking decisions. Three MCDA approaches (the UTADIS method, the ELECTRE TRI method, and the rough set approach) are applied in financial and banking problems, such as business failure prediction, credit–risk assessment, and portfolio selection and management. A comparison is also performed with linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and logit analysis. International Federation of Operational Research Societies 2002.},

abstract={In India, Telecom sector has been enduring a massive growth for over two and half decades in the bandwidth, preference of services and depth of penetration in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Exploring the service providers or selecting the best cellular mobile telephone service providers (CMTSPs/TSPs) according to operational performance parameter can help to achieve the goal of telecom service provider selection (TSPS). Here, this assessment generally comprises various TSPs alternatives and different operational performance criteria; therefore, TSPS could be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The analytical data have been taken from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Jan–Mar 2017. Most of the data vary from 1 month to another. Thus, these small ranges of variation in the data are incorporated with the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). In this paper, we develop an outranking method, intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE (IF-ELECTRE), for MCDM problems. Proposed method is based on divergence measure, operators of IFNs, some modifications of classical ELECTRE method. In the MCDM, the criterion weight determination is a vital issue for the accuracy of evaluation results. In the process of calculation of criterion weight, concordance and discordance values, we propose new Jensen–Shannon divergence (JS-divergence) for IFSs to overcome the shortcoming of the existing ones and demonstrate different elegant properties of the proposed one. Since the uncertainty is an inevitable feature of MCDM problems, the proposed method can be a valuable tool for decision-making in an uncertain atmosphere to determine the partial-preference outranking order. To express the strength and reasonableness of the proposed method in the real-world MCDM problems, a TSPS problem is implemented. Using the proposed framework, a decision expert can make a strategy to improve the performance by benchmarking operational parameters. Finally, a comparison is discussed between the results of the proposed method and the existing ones for validating the proposed method. This analysis shows that the proposed method is efficient and well consistent with the other methods. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={The protection of cultural heritage is essential to preserve the memory of the territory and its communities, but its enhancement is also important. In this perspective, the theme of choosing the best use for historic buildings, which often make up a substantial and widespread part of real estate and which can become a driving force for the sustainable development of cities, is important. These decision-making processes find effective support tools in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, able to consider the multiple financial, social, cultural, and environmental effects that the enhancement project generates. In order to identify the most appropriate evaluation approach to select the best use of the building, this paper proposes a comparison between some of the best-knownMCDM methods: Analitic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE), Tecnique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and the Compromise Ranking Method (VIKOR). The comparative analysis gives rise to the validity of the AHP, which is useful for reducing the problem into its essential components, so as to make a rational comparison among the design alternatives based on different criteria. The novelty of the research is the characterization of the hierarchical structure of the model, as well as the selection of criteria and indicators of economic evaluation. The application of the model to a real case of recovery and enhancement of a former convent in the province of Salerno (Italy) verifies the effectiveness of the tool and its adaptability to the specificities of the case study. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Pumped hydro-energy storage (PHES) development involves heavy investment with stringent environmental and social requirements. Therefore, selecting the best site is a key influencer of the plant's ability to sustainably provide the expected benefits throughout its whole lifecycle. An important contribution could be provided by developing specific tools for improving decision accuracy while addressing the issue of sustainability through the decision-making process. In this view, this study aims to propose a decision-making model for selecting the best alternative from a number of predetermined PHES candidate sites, in a perspective of sustainable development. The approach is based on the identification of decision factors and criteria, and the use of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), rating scales and fuzzy logic-based scoring systems, and the ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) III. These methods are comprehensively selected and combined to deal with the heterogeneity of the information and the vagueness of human preference and, to operationalise the concept of strong sustainability. Its practicality and efficiency was successfully tested on a set of eleven PHES candidate sites in Western Cameroon. As result the five best alternatives to be considered in the framework of the country's sustainable power generation policy were suggested in descending order of priority: (1)-Enep, (2)-Mbatu-dam, (3)-Benakuma, (4)-Bamendjin, (5)-Mentchum. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Over the last decades, the delivery of water supply services has changed among regions and actors, in order to meet the changing needs. Those services can be balanced based on the relation between the obligations they must fulfill, the quality offered, and the associated price/value for money. Furthermore, due to the water services inherent characteristics, they are prone to poor quality of service (in general terms). Thus, global performance assessments are of paramount relevance under those constraints. In Portugal, the water regulator has developed a system of performance indicators (partial measures of performance) and, therefore, it is not possible to achieve the desired holistic performance evaluation (global measure). To enable such assessment, we propose an application based on the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to define quality of service categories and aggregate performance indicators. To obtain a coherent family of criteria (i.e., exhaustive, cohesive, and non-redundant) we apply an iso-preference logic. The results obtained are presented through a geographical information system allowing for a clearer visualization of the overall performance of water utilities. The method proposed can be considered a suitable decision support system and useful regulatory tool able to provide policy relevant outputs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

To measure the degree of agreement and the degree of disagreement of the proposition "one alternative outranks another alternative", the concordance and discordance relations are usually associated with the outranking relation. Instead of the traditional single-layer perceptron (SLP) developed according to the multiple-attribute utility theory, this paper contributes to develop a novel ELECTRE-based SLP for multicriteria classification problems based on the ELECTRE methods involving pairwise comparisons among patterns. A genetic-algorithm-based method is then designed to determine connection weights. A real-world data set involving bankruptcy analysis obtained from Moody's Industrial Manuals is employed to examine the classification performance of the proposed ELECTRE-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model performs well compared to an arsenal of well-known classification methods involving quantitative disciplines of statistics and machine learning. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a comparative study of three popular methods for multicriteria decision analysis based on a particular model of human preferential judgement. Since decisions are invariably made within a given context, we model relative preferences as ratios of increments or decrements in an interval on an axis of desirability. Next we sort the ratio magnitudes into a small number of categories, represented by numerical values on a geometric scale. We explain why the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the French collection of ELECTRE methods, typically based on pairwise comparison methods, are concerned with categories of ratio magnitudes, whereas the simple multiattribute rating technique (SMART) essentially uses orders of magnitude of these ratios. This phenomenon provides a common basis for the analysis of the methods in question and for a cross-validation of their results. We illustrate the approach via a well-known case study, the choice of a location for a nuclear power plant. We conclude by discussing the scope of the comparative study. © 1997 John Wiley &&num;38; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={A large number of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been proposed in the past and applied to water resources planning. The development and application of systems analysis techniques to assist decision makers in evaluating project alternatives having more than one objective in river basin planning is of recent origin. In this paper an attempt is made to demonstrate the use of ELECTRE (ELimination and (Et) Choice Translating REality) I and ELECTRE-II techniques for water resources planning in one of the major river basins (Krishna river basin) of South India. The river basin consists of 8 reservoirs and a diversion work. Formulation of the problem is provided leading to an array of 27 alternative systems (different combinations of reservoirs with a minimum of three in each alternative) with 6 criteria related to: (i) irrigation, (ii) power production, (iii) drinking water, (iv) environmental quality; (v) floods and (vi) cost of the project. Out of the six criteria two, namely environmental quality and floods, are qualitative in nature. A set of best alternative systems with their partial ordering is obtained from ELECTRE-I, which forms the input for ELECTRE-II. Complete ordering of the reduced alternatives is achieved with ELECTRE-II. Sensitivity analysis shows that changing the weights assigned to each criterion has greater effect on the results than does changing the scales. However, neither effect is significant. Therefore it is recommended that ELECTRE-I be used for screening alternatives under consideration and ELECTRE-II for complete ordering of the reduced set. © 1995, International Association on Water Quality.

abstract={Today, small and large business houses operate collaboratively for the efficiency in the functioning of supply chains. Larger organisations mostly depend on small companies to supply majority of its components and thus they need to be careful while selecting their suppliers. Small organisations performing innovatively and supplying technologically upgraded as well as quality products at a cheaper rate can be a boon for the larger enterprise. This study develops a model for evaluating and selecting small firms as suppliers on the basis of their innovativeness. Best–Worst multi-criteria method is used to rank criteria of innovativeness and also to calculate their weights on the basis of expert opinion. Fuzzy TOPSIS methodology is used to rank the suppliers with respect to these criteria and finally select the best supplier among the available alternatives. A real-world application is illustrated by taking a case of auto component manufacturer and its seven suppliers, 5 main criteria and 23 sub-criteria are taken up for the study.

abstract={Bioplastics are biobased materials, usually easy biodegradable, derived from renewable resources. Evolution of bioplastics production is related to: bio starch and starch mixtures (74.5%); bioplastic products from fermentation (13%), bioplastic from petrochemicals materials (12.5%). They are seen as a viable solution to avoid some environmental impacts caused by the use of fossil-based conventional plastics. In this context, the general objectives of this study entail the analysis and selection of the optimal alternative of bioplastics able to be used for packaging production, considering social, economic and environmental criteria. In order to accomplish these objectives, we applied the ELECTRE method (ELimination Et Choix TRaduisant la RealitÉ), a multi-criteria analysis method. Application of this method enables the use of qualitative and quantitative discrete criteria, making also possible alternatives ranking. The application of ELECTRE method in our study consisted in selecting different types of bioplastics which were compared considering some consistent criteria so as to assess their economic and environmental performances. Based on the application of multiple criteria evaluation we concluded that bioplastics, in particular polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are suitable from economic and environmental points of views for manufacturing and utilization of packaging. © 2015, Gh.

abstract={Multiple criteria sorting methods assign alternatives to predefined ordered categories taking multiple criteria into consideration. The Electre Tri method compares alternatives to several profiles separating the categories. Based on such comparisons, each alternative is assigned to the lowest (resp. highest) category for which it is at least as good as the lower profile (resp. is strictly preferred by the higher profile) of the category, and the corresponding assignment rule is called pessimistic (resp. optimistic). We propose algorithms for eliciting the criteria weights and majority threshold in a version of the optimistic Electre Tri rule, which raises additional difficulties w.r.t. the pessimistic rule. We also describe an algorithm that computes robust alternatives assignments from assignment examples. These algorithms proceed by solving mixed integer programs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to test the proposed algorithms on the following issues: learning ability of the algorithm to reproduce the DMs preference, robustness analysis and ability to identify conflicting preference information in case of inconsistencies in the learning set. Experiments show that eliciting the criteria weights in an accurate way requires quite a number of assignment examples. Furthermore, considering more criteria increases the information requirement. The present empirical study allows us to draw some lessons in view of practical applications of Electre Tri using the optimistic rule. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, in this study a fifty-attribute framework for mined land suitability analysis including fifty numbers of economical, social, technical and mine site factors developed to be a foundation for this decision making problem. Analysis by an outranking multi-attribute decision-making technique, called elimination et choix traduisant la realite method, was taken into consideration because of its clear advantages on the field of mined land suitability analysis as compared with multi-attribute decision-making ranking techniques. Analytical hierarchy process method applied to calculate global weights of the attributes through pair wise comparison matrixes. The weights then passed to the elimination et choix traduisant la realit method so that the most efficient post mining land uses could be appointed through comparisons of pair-wise dominance relationships between alternatives. This approach applied to an illustrative example where, final results showed that, there were two non-dominated land-uses for the considered example; industrial and pasture. However by increasing indifference threshold limit, the non-dominated set reduced to a single alternative that was pasture land-use. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.},

abstract={First, a set of major gear design criteria are used to develop six material performance indices for material selection purposes. They are, a surface fatigue limit index, a surface fatigue lifetime index, a bending fatigue limit index, a bending fatigue lifetime index, an abrasive wear index, and a machinability index. A modified decision matrix in the presence of data uncertainties and incompleteness is then proposed to show the effect of the developed indices. It is shown that using individual material properties and approximations among them may not satisfy specific design goals for a specific application. Next, the ELECTRE III multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) model is applied to rank the best compromised candidate materials, while considering criteria tradeoffs, designers' preference information, data uncertainties and incompleteness. An effort is made to reconcile mathematically motivated model thresholds (namely, the indifference, strict preference, and veto thresholds) with experimentally motivated characteristics such as upper and lower limits of measured material properties. It is shown that the proposed multi-criteria approach may also be useful in revealing incomparable and/or indifferent alternatives that would not be distinguishable otherwise. To ensure rank stability of the chosen materials, the effect of potential uncertainties in designers' opinions during criteria weighting is introduced by means of a dilation and concentration sensitivity analysis process. The main originality lies in resolving a non-compensatory, application-specific, and uncertainty-based multiple criteria material selection problem in gear design optimization. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={In this study, a three-echelon fuzzy green vehicle routing problem (3E-FGVRP) is considered for designing a regional agri-food supply chain on a time horizon. To account for the variability associated with the quantities requested by customers, it is assumed that the demands are fuzzy numbers simulated by a time-dependent algorithm. Moreover, the vehicle fleet and distribution centres are considered with a defined capacity. The credibility theory of fuzzy sets is used to implement a multi-objective fuzzy chance-constrained programming model, where the total costs and carbon emissions are minimised. The resolution of the 3E-FGVRP is conducted by using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The multiple-criteria decision-making ELECTRE III method is applied to select the best solutions belonging to each Pareto front. Finally, the validity of the model is demonstrated by performing an optimisation procedure with three different initial random sets of populations. The application of the model to a case study of the Sicilian agri-food context confirms the robustness of the model, and the optimal configurations of the three-echelon supply chain can be found. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

As an extension of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, we develop an m-polar fuzzy linguistic TOPSIS approach for multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). It is used to evaluate the best alternative, to get more authentic and comparable results and to handle the real life problems of having multi-polar information in terms of linguistic variables and values. In this approach decision-makers contribute their estimations in the form of linguistic term sets. To show the efficiency and compatibility of the proposed approach, we compare it with the m-polar fuzzy linguistic ELECTRE-I (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) approach. Finally, we draw a flow chart of our proposed approach as an algorithm and generate a computer programming code. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a novel outranking method using a risk attitudinal assignment model under complex uncertainty based on Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets. Additionally, this paper applies the proposed methodology to address financial decision-making problems to investigate its applicability and effectiveness in the real world. These developed methods and techniques can provide a new viewpoint for capturing the amount of information conveyed by PF and IVPF values and can fully take into account the decision maker's attitude towards risk-taking in the face of high uncertainty. Considering the diverse attitudes toward risk neutrality, risk seeking, and risk aversion, this paper introduces novel measures of risk attitude-based score functions within the PF/IVPF environments and investigates their desirable and useful properties. These properties provide a means of establishing linear orders and admissible orders in the PF/IVPF contexts. This means that the proposed measures can overcome some drawbacks and ambiguities of the previous techniques through score and accuracy functions and can address incomparable PF/IVPF information more effectively. As an application of the risk attitude-based score functions, this paper develops novel risk attitudinal assignment models to establish a useful outranking approach for solving multiple criteria decision-making problems. Two algorithms for PF and IVPF settings are developed based on the concepts of a precedence frequency matrix and a precedence contribution matrix for conducting multiple criteria evaluation and the ranking of alternatives. A financing decision on aggressive/conservative policies of working capital management is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed outranking approach in real situations. Moreover, a comparison to the technique of risk attitudinal ranking methods is investigated to validate the advantages of the proposed methodology. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with a newly developed outranking method, the IVPF-ELECTRE (for the elimination and choice translating reality), is conducted via an application to the investment problem of software development projects. Compared with these benchmark approaches, the proposed methods can produce a more reasonable and persuasive result for ranking the order relationships of alternatives in the highly uncertain context. The practical studies and comparative discussions demonstrate an excellent performance of the developed methodology that is effective and flexible enough to accommodate more-complex decision-making environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Green supplier selection problem has become a developing concept which could enhance the performance of companies regarding the environmental competencies. In order to deal with the uncertainty of green supplier selection problems, this paper proposes an extended elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method based on the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set. In this method, the weight or relative importance of each expert is measured through the proposed interval-valued hesitant fuzzy extended preference selection index method. Also, the importance of each attribute is calculated using the developed maximizing deviation method so that loss of data will be prevented. Afterward, the weights of experts and attributes are used in the proposed interval-valued hesitant fuzzy extended ELECTRE (IVHFE-ELECTRE) method, and in so doing, calculation errors in the proposed algorithm decrease. In the classical approaches, the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy effective outranking matrix may not assist to rank the suppliers. Thus, a novel ranking index is proposed by considering indifference, preference and veto thresholds for each attribute to compare the equivalent ranking of green suppliers. In addition, a case study of the automobile manufacturing industry is used to evaluate the candidate suppliers regarding environmental competencies from the recent literature to verify the proposed IVHFE-ELECTRE method. Also, a comparative analysis based on two outranking methods from the recent literature is elaborated to represent the merits and advantages of the proposed approach. Finally, a sensitivity analysis and quite a few simulation-based experiments are prepared to sensitiveness and validation of the proposed method, respectively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Supplier evaluation and categorization is an important decision process in supplier management. It relies on judgements by multiple decision makers about the performance of a supplier on a set of criteria. Uncertainty of judgements, non-compensation between criteria and group decision are the main requirements of the decision process that have to be considered. However, none of the studies found in the literature presents a solution that contemplates all this requirements at the same time. Therefore, aiming to bridge this gap, this paper proposes an approach to supplier categorization based on the use of ELECTRE TRI combined with hesitant fuzzy. ELECTRE TRI is a non-compensatory multicriteria decision making method specific for categorization. Hesitant fuzzy is used prior to it to aggregate linguistic judgements of multiple decision makers. The decision process model is detailed and implemented in Matlab©. Analyses of the results of an illustrative case of application in the automotive industry show consistent categorization results, particularly using the pessimistic ELECTRE TRI categorization procedure. But, when there is too much discordance, negotiation techniques may be a better option. Also, test with different criteria weights showed no change in the categorization results, confirming the non-compensatory effect of the technique. © 2018},

abstract={The development of more sustainable energy systems is at the top of political agendas around the world. Sustainability is inherently a multi-criteria concept, thus it is appropriate to use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This methodology facilitates the intricate decision process by which decision makers must go through to agree on robust long-term alternatives for the sustainable development of existing municipal energy systems taking economic/financial, technical, social and environmental criteria into account. This work presents a methodology to help local authorities with the development of an Energy Action Plan (EAP) towards more sustainable municipal energy systems and, simultaneously, ease the related decision process, by using MCDA. The developed methodology was applied to the municipality of Odemira, Portugal. After several interactions with stakeholders, a set of 16 actions was chosen. Once applied the ELECTRE III method, public lighting, the conversion of the swimming pool water heaters for biomass fueled, the matching of bus and train schedules and the installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the municipal exposition park were the best-ranked actions to be adopted. Also, up to 3 kton of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided per year if the EAP is implemented, being observed higher benefits at the residential and services sectors. The decision of implementing these actions now stands with the municipality, which should start by implementing the most preferred actions first, and then proceed with the implementation of the subsequent actions, according to financial and human resources availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multi-functionality of agriculture and rural areas has an impact on the economy, the environment, nature and also on societal and cultural development. The dimensions of multi-functionality are interpreted in literature in many different ways, but they always deal with environmental, social and economic aspects. The measurement of the multi-functionality of the agri-food system is an important issue, as it allows the value chain to be interpreted under the lens of sustainable development pillars. In this paper, we argue that multi-functionality is a value, which extends its benefits along the entire agri-food chain. We present a methodology to aggregate indicators into an evaluation framework, in order to assess the level of multi-functionality along the entire food value chain. We have called this the “extended value” of multi-functionality, since our approach is able to consider not only the farm level, but also extends to the entire food chain. To analyse multi-functionality, it was necessary to build Non-Commodity Categories (NCC) based on Non-Commodity Output (NCO), which characterised the value added function along the agri-food value chain. A set of indicators was developed to measure the level of multi-functionality in each NCC. The Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methodology ELECTRE III was used to implement an evaluation process by assigning specific importance to each indicator. This process aggregated the evaluations of multiple indicators into an integrated interpretation, and aimed to support policy makers by providing a ranking of alternative ruling policies for the agri-food value chain. We finally tested our methodological approach on the value chain for the olive oil of five European countries, to analyse which value chain was able to generate more beneficial functions above and beyond the product itself. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increasing demand on energy due to population growth and rise of living standards has led to considerable use of fossil fuels which cause environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel proves to be a good alternative for fossil fuels. But sustainability of biodiesel is the key factor for determining it as a fuel in diesel engines. It needs identification of proper blend of biodiesel and diesel to meet the efficiency, engine suitability and environmental acceptability. Alternative fuel blend evaluation in IC engine fuel technologies is a very important strategic decision tool involving balancing between a number of criteria such as performance, emission and combustion parameters and opinions from different decision maker of IC engine experts. Hence, it is a MCDM problem. This paper describes the application of hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for the selection of optimum biodiesel blend in IC engine. FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE, are the three methods that are used to evaluate the best blend. The performances of these MCDM methods are also compared with each other. Here, FAHP is used to determine the relative weights of the criteria, whereas TOPSIS, VIKOR and ELECTRE are used for obtaining the final ranking of alternatives. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW is used for exploratory analysis of evaluation criteria at different load conditions. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blends are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel. Similarly, Brake thermal efficiency (BTE), Exhaust gas temperature (EGT), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Smoke, Hydrocarbon (HC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Ignition Delay, Combustion Duration and Maximum Rate of Pressure Rise are considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking of alternatives obtained by FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE are B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B40 &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100 for 21°bTDC and 24°bTDC and Diesel &gt; B20 &gt; B40 &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100 for 27°bTDC. It shows that B20 is ranked first for 21°bTDC and 24°bTDC and second for 27°bTDC injection timing. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 20% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good replacement for diesel. This paper provides a new insight of applying MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend by decision makers such as engine manufactures and R&amp;D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower green revolution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Manufacturing systems are processes in which inputs obtained from interior and exterior sources are transformed into an output by gathering inputs in an optimal way to guide the enterprises. Machining process plays a critical role in industry, and thus, directly affects the efficiency of the manufacturing systems.

This study provides distinct systematic approaches in fuzzy and crisp environments to deal with the selection problem of proper machining process and proposes a decision support model for the guidance of decision makers to assess potentials of seven distinct nontraditional machining processes, namely laser beam machining, plasma arc machining, water jet machining, abrasive water jet machining, electrochemical machining, electrical discharge machining (EDM), and wire-EDM in the cutting process of carbon structural steel with the width of plate of 10 mm. The required data for decision and weight matrices are obtained via a questionnaire to specialists, as well as by deep discussions with experts and making use of past studies.

The proposed methodology was designed to address the particularities of the Greek case, regarding the type and availability of risk and spatial data. It incorporates a broad set of multiple and conflicting criteria that arise in land-use planning decisions, through the application of a well known multi-criteria decision analysis method (ELECTRE TRI).

abstract={Water is involved, directly or indirectly, with many activities and needs that have to be met. The large scale and importance of water projects, the investments needed, the difficulty in predicting the results, and the irreversible character of the decisions have made decision making a complex scientific process. This paper presents a multicriteria analysis (MCA) tool for evaluating water resource management (WRM) strategies and selecting the most appropriate among them, using as an example a Greek area based on agricultural economy, which faces water scarcity problems. Seven alternative strategies were evaluated under hydrological and economic criteria. Four techniques were used-multi attribute utility theory (MAUT), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based on the main MCA techniques (utility theory, analytical hierarchy, outranking theory, and classification theory, respectively), to compare their performance, and to reach the most appropriate and 'fitting' method for the examined problem. The weightings extracted from two samples, (i) a sample of decision makers/stakeholders and (ii) a group of WRM experts, were used to compare the results. The process was carried out for each questionnaire, and thus the model shows the uncertainty of each sample group and of each method, as well as the overall uncertainty. The results illustrate the reality of the WRM problems of the watershed, enlighten their roots, and have further strengthened our conviction that the cooperation between the scientific community and the authorities is vital for more sustainable and efficient WRM. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The imprecise quality of service (QoS) evaluations from consumers may lead to the inappropriate prediction for the trustworthiness of cloud services in an uncertain cloud environment. The service ranking prediction is a promising idea to overcome this deficiency of values prediction approaches by probing the ordering relations between cloud services concealed in the imprecise evaluations. To address the challenges for trustworthy service selection resulting from fluctuating QoS, flexible service pricing and complicated potential risks, this paper proposes a time-aware approach to predict the trustworthiness ranking of cloud services, with the tradeoffs between performance-cost and potential risks in multiple periods. In this approach, the interval neutrosophic set (INS) theory is utilized to describe and assess the performance-costs and potential risks of cloud services: (1) the original evaluation data about cloud services are preprocessed into the trustworthiness interval neutrosophic numbers (INNs); (2) the new INS operators are proposed with the theoretical proofs to calculate the possibility degree and the ranking values of trustworthiness INNs, contributing to the identification of the neighboring users based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (KRCC). The problem of time-aware trustworthiness ranking prediction is formulated as a multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) problem of creating a ranked services list using INS, and an improved ELECTRE method is developed to solve it. The proposed approach is verified by experiments based on an appropriate baseline for comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a better prediction quality than the existing approach. The results also show that our approach works effectively in the risk-sensitive and performance-cost-sensitive application scenarios and prevent the malignant price competition launched by low-quality services. © 2017},

abstract={The surface transport infrastructure (i.e. road and rail) has seen increasing pressure in recent years to achieve better sustainability performance. Transport Noise Reducing Devices (NRDs) form a major part of the surface transport infrastructure system in mitigating undesirable surface noise pollution to impacted communities. Their sustainability is a growing interest for practitioners and policy makers in this area as NRDs projects now have to balance integrating and assessing social, environmental, and economic objectives besides meeting key technical requirements. This paper presents an account of the first study carried out to assess the absolute sustainability of NRDs via the application of multi criteria analysis (MCA) techniques. The general procedure, selection of criteria, data gathering, and the use of three MCA techniques, SAW (Simple Additive Weighting), PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organisation MeTHod for Enrichment Evaluations), and ELECTRE III (Elimination et Choice Translating Reality), to assess the absolute sustainability of two built and operating European NRDs projects (one in Spain, and one in Italy) is presented. The novel concept of defining an Optimal Hypothetic Ideal Solution (OHIS) to assess the sustainability of NRDs in absolute terms to achieve this end is also introduced and discussed. The presented case studies will thus provide a useful model for practitioners to adopt or amend to conduct their own assessments of NRDs' sustainability. The paper further concludes that the generation of index values by the three MCA techniques to denote the overall absolute sustainability of solutions is a useful feature for communicating the sustainability of NRDs across a broad range of stakeholders, and for conducting "what-if" analyses. The presented research could also support broader aims of developing harmonized sustainability standards for the NRDs industry to adopt and so forward the sustainability transport agenda. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Objective: The aim of this paper is to apply an informatics tool for dealing with a medical decision aiding problem to help infertile couples to become parents, when using assisted reproduction. Methods: A multiple criteria decision aiding method for sorting or ordinal classification problems, called Electre Tri-C, was chosen in order to assign each couple to an embryo-transfer category. The set of categories puts in evidence a way for increasing the single pregnancy rate, while minimizing multiple pregnancies. The decision aiding sorting model was co-constructed through an interaction process between the decision aiding analysts and the medical experts. Results: According to the sample used in this study, the Electre Tri-C method provides a unique category in 86% of the cases and it achieves a sorting accuracy of 61%. Retrospectively, the medical experts do agree that some of their judgments concerning the number of embryos to transfer back to the uterus of the woman could be different according to these results. The current ART methodology achieves a single pregnancy rate of 47% and a twin pregnancy rate of 14%. Thus, this informatics tools may play an important role for supporting ART medical decisions, aiming to increase the single pregnancy rate, while minimizing multiple pregnancies. Limitations: Building the set of criteria comprises a part of arbitrariness and imperfect knowledge, which require time and expertise to be refined. Among them, three criteria are modeled by means of a holistic classification procedure by the medical experts. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The present paper deals with the analysis of these flight data, their uncertainties and with the study of the corresponding experimental Simula^ tion in the new Arc Heated High Enthalpy Facility F4. This facility is able to match the speed and the binary scaling parameter, RhoL, of the ELECTRE flight for that part of its trajectory where sufficient real gas effects are measurable. The study of this extrapolation to flight is done with a non-equilibrium Navier-Stokes code. The influence of partial free stream dissociation, due to the non- equilibrium freezing of the species, resulting from the rapid expansion of the flow in the nozzle has been taken into account. The paper shows that the extrapolation to flight of the heat flux by using the binary scaling and by keeping the total enthalpy the same, is only feasible in the nose region where the dissociation reactions are predominant. For the conical aft part of the standard model larger differences in Stanton are observed and binary scaling becomes less accurate. Finally the use of CFD for the ” design ” of an experimental campaign lias been demonstrated by identifying the regions within the wind tunnel envelope where real gas effects significantly change the heat flux distribution. © 1992 AIAA 17th Aerospace Ground Testing Conference},

abstract={The Z-number provides an adequate and reliable description of cognitive information. The nature of Z-numbers is complex, however, and important issues in Z-number computation remain to be addressed. This study focuses on developing a computationally simple method with Z-numbers to address multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Processing Z-numbers requires the direct computation of fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainties. We used an effective method to analyze the Z-number construct. Next, we proposed some outranking relations of Z-numbers and defined the dominance degree of discrete Z-numbers. Also, after analyzing the characteristics of elimination and choice translating reality III (ELECTRE III) and qualitative flexible multiple criteria method (QUALIFLEX), we developed an improved outranking method. To demonstrate this method, we provided an illustrative example concerning job-satisfaction evaluation. We further verified the validity of the method by a criteria test and comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that the method can be successfully applied to real-world decision-making problems, and it can identify more reasonable outcomes than previous methods. This study overcomes the high computational complexity in existing Z-number computation frameworks by exploring the pairwise comparison of Z-numbers. The method inherits the merits of the classical outranking method and considers the non-compensability of criteria. Therefore, it has remarkable potential to address practical decision-making problems involving Z-information. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background/Introduction: Randomness and roughness commonly exist simultaneously in one decision-making problem in the real world; however, fewer systematic studies have been carried out for such problems. Methods: In this study, we employ interval-valued rough random variables (IRRVs) and interval-valued rough numbers (IRNs) to process decision information. Additionally, we propose a more reasonable comparison method of IRNs. We combine and extend the stochastic dominance of IRRVs and the classic ELECTRE III method (a useful outranking method). Finally, we develop an extended ELECTRE III approach for rough stochastic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. We provide examples concerning site selection and investment appraisal in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach. We verify the applicability and advantages of our approach through comparative analyses with other existing methods. Results: Illustrative and comparative analyses indicate that our proposed approach is feasible for many practical MCDM problems, and the final ranking results of the proposed approach are more accurate and consistent with those obtained in actual decision-making processes. Conclusion: The IRNs and IRRVs are useful for dealing with rough stochastic decision information. The proposed approach is feasible and effective for solving rough stochastic MCDM problems, and retains the merits of IRRVs, SD relations, and outranking methods. The final outcomes from our approach are convincing and consist with actual decision-making. Thus, our proposed approach is more widely applicable. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={For certain critical equipment items in marine machinery systems, the optimum maintenance strategy would be a scheduled on-condition operation. This involves inspection of the equipment items in order to monitor their performance degradation and, invariably, carry out repair or replacement tasks. The main challenge with this type of maintenance approach is the determination of the appropriate interval for performing the inspection task. This paper presents a methodology which integrates multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools with a delay time model for the determination of optimum inspection intervals for marine machinery systems. With this approach, multiple decision criteria are modelled with the delay time concept and aggregated with MCDM tools such that different criteria can be applied simultaneously in the ranking of different inspection interval alternatives. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using the case study of a water cooling pump of the central cooling system of a marine diesel engine. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Small and medium sized water utilities (SMWU) are facing serious operational problems, and show less participation in benchmarking. Existing performance indicator (PI) systems developed for large water utilities need to be re-evaluated for SMWU. 114 Potential PIs were obtained in water resources and environment, personnel, operational, physical, water quality, quality of service and financial categories using a checklist. These PIs were evaluated against applicability, understandability, measurability and comparability criteria using the Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) outranking method for multicriteria decision analysis. The criteria's weights and scoring of PIs were done through group decision making. The study results revealed that ELECTRE is a suitable method when the preferences between various alternatives based on small differences of evaluations cannot be established. The network maps based on outranking results provides an opportunity to the utility management to encompass the most suitable PIs based on data availability and specific needs of their utility. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The necessity of sustainability evaluation is rapidly growing alongside the expansion of civilization. Likewise, the supply chain suitability improvement is a need that has arisen in the petroleum industry, especially as it is responsible for the most part of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. The modeling of this kind of problem deals with multiple criteria evaluations. This paper proposes an original multiple-criteria based approach to classifying the degree of organizational sustainability. This proposal was applied to evaluate a representative set of companies, which are suppliers of the Brazilian petroleum industry. The data collection was supported by a questionnaire. The results highlight that the studied companies have not yet reached an advanced level of maturity in the sustainability context. In a comprehensive vision of sustainability based on Triple Bottom Line (TBL), these companies are either in the initial stage or in the implementation phase of the sustainability practices.},

This perception is a result of a complex integration of multiple criteria. This paper approaches the analysis of regional competitiveness by techniques of multi-criteria sorting. An ELECTRE-based preference model is used in the framework of the new THESEUS multi-criteria evaluation method for making competitiveness assignments. The model's parameters are inferred from a set of assignment examples. This model is implemented in the CORE decision support system, which satisfies a requirement of Sinaloa State Government in Mexico. CORE performs very well analyzing the competitiveness of Mexican regional entities. This will allow governments to better define their policies by placing financial resources more efficiently. The model and the system are conceived to easily emigrate towards other regional contexts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In next generation wireless network mobile terminals will have access to different wireless network technologies. Mobile terminals will switch (Handover) its connections from one access network to other access network of same (Horizontal Handover) or different technology (Vertical Hanover) according to QoS (Quality of Service) demand of applications or user preferences. Vertical Handover is an expensive process in terms of signaling and delay therefore multiple criteria should be consider in handover decision making which complicate the handover process. Therefore optimization of decision making process is currently an important issue for research. In this paper we applied fuzzy Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) in handover decision making. Fuzzy MADM will eliminate the ambiguity in decision making because of different, contradictory and imprecise data collected from different sources. In this paper we also proposed a new User Adaptive Fuzzy MADM handover decision scheme. In addition we applied different fuzzy MADM methods i.e. TOPSIS, SAW, Maximin, ELECTRE and AHP to find out best alternative for handover and to evaluate the performance of these methods. At the end results of popular fuzzy MADM methods are compared. © 2011 AICIT.},

It includes a database, simulation models, user-friendly interfaces, and multicriteria analysis models. SADREG is comprised of two components: design and selection. The first component applies database information, and through several simulation and computational tools, produces a set of design alternatives in agreement with the user options. These alternatives are characterized by several hydraulic, economic, and environmental indicators that allow appropriate selection and ranking. The selection component bases upon multicriteria analysis using composite programming and ELECTRE II ranking models, which support the decision maker to select the best alternative. The decision maker participates in all decision processes through a user-friendly interface that allows expressing design options and priorities. SADREG was tested with data collected from field experiments. In addition to describing the modeling approach, an application to a sector of the Lower Mondego Irrigation Project, Portugal, is presented. © 2009 ASCE.},

abstract={This work proposes a Progressive Assisted Sorting Algorithm (PASA) based on a multicriteria evaluation ELECTRE-type method. The purpose of the PASA is to aid a decision maker to progressively sort a set of alternatives into a set of categories, which we considered are ordered (ordinal sorting), following a consistency principle. We consider the principle that if an alternative outranks (is as good as) a second one, then it must belong to the same category or to a better category. The set of alternatives already sorted by the decision maker will implicitly define the categories, and will constrain the range of categories where other alternatives may be sorted. We show how the same idea may be used in an aggregation/disaggregation approach, considering some parameters of ELECTRE are not fixed a priori, but are constrained only by the examples provided. In this context, we establish a "convex-shape property" stating that the range of possible categories for an alternative is always an interval of categories. A discussion contrasting this approach with ELECTRE TRI is included in the conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The concept of sustainability in wastewater reclamation and reuse in the Mediterranean area needs to be expressed in a realistic and practical way. This paper suggests a suitable methodology for sustainable wastewater reuse in the Mediterranean area by considering not only technical and economic, but also, environmental and social aspects of wastewater reuse. Alternative strategies based on different treatment and storage technologies are evaluated by using the Multicriterion Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Alternative strategies are formulated by combining elements such as different treatments, different disposal sites, the type of irrigation scheme, crop pattern, water pricing and the use of fertilizers. The criteria used to evaluate the most sustainable strategy include firstly public health and environmental factors, that pose risks on human health, water pollution during and after irrigation, efficiency of water use, secondly economic factors, including the water cost, the initial cost of the irrigation system, maintenance costs and crop profitability, and thirdly social issues including the employment of rural labour. Various MCDA techniques, namely, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4 and Compromise Programming (CP) may be employed to rank alternative strategies and find out the most sustainable alternative.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce split truth/falseness semantics for a multi-valued logical processing of fuzzy preference modelling. Our approach takes as starting point the standard framework of fuzzy outranking relations as proposed by the French multi-criteria decision aid community. Formal links between a given relational credibility calculus and associated truth polarization techniques will be discussed. The main result is the establishment of a multi-valued logical framework which allows us to naturally postpone any necessary defuzzification step to the end of the decision problem. Scope and purpose In this paper we propose an innovative multi-valued logical framework for processing fuzzy preferential information as is common in the context of multi-criteria preference modelling. Our results concern a methodological and computational enhancement of the Electre decision aid methods as promoted by the French school of decision aid around the work of B. Roy and D. Bouyssou (Roy. Methodologie Multicritere d'Aide a la Decision. Paris: Economica, 1985; Roy and Bouyssou. Aide Multicritere a la Decision: Methodes et cas. Paris: Economica, 1993). The main achievement concerns the implementation of a logically coherent defuzzification technique in order to make commute logical reasoning and defuzzification of preferential information.

abstract={In this paper, we introduce certain aggregation operators, namely, the m-polar fuzzy (mF) Hamacher weighted average operator, mF Hamacher ordered weighted average (mFHOWA) operator, mF Hamacher hybrid average (mFHHA) operator, mF Hamacher weighted geometric (mFHWG) operator, mF Hamacher weighted ordered geometric operator, and mF Hamacher hybrid geometric (mFHHG) operator. We discuss some properties of these operators, inclusive of their ability to implement both symmetric and asymmetric treatments of the items. We develop an algorithmic model to solve multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems in mF environment using mF Hamacher weighted average operator (mFHWA) and mFHWG operators. They can compensate for the possible asymmetric roles of the attributes that describe the problem. In the end, to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed work, we give applications for selecting the most affected country regarding human trafficking, selecting health care waste treatment methods and selecting the best company for investment. We also solve practical MADM problems by using ELECTRE-I method, and give a comparative analysis. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Intermodal transport is one of the key elements for sustainable freight transport at large and medium distances. However, its efficiency in many cases depends on the location of the railroad container terminals (CT). The favorable position of Serbia provides an opportunity to establish a large number of container trains, which can lead to a more developed intermodal transport system in the entire Balkans and beyond. In this paper the problem of the container terminal location in Serbia has been considered and resolved. The aim of this paper is to determine the potential macro location of the CT in Serbia, which will be most suitable for different stakeholders in the transport chain. Choosing the most suitable alternative is a complex multi-criteria task. For this reason, a multi criteria decision-making model has been formulated which consists of a number of alternatives and criteria. Alternatives represent potential areas for a site, while some of the criteria are: Cargo flows, infrastructure, economic development, social and transport attractiveness and environmental acceptability. For defining weights of the criteria two approaches are used, namely, the Delphi and the Entropy method. In this paper three methods of the multi criteria decision-making, namely, TOPSIS, ELECTRE and MABAC are used. By comparing the results of these three methods, an answer to the question where to locate CT will be presented. This is the first step in determining the location of the container terminal. The next phase should respond to the issue of micro location of the terminal. Also, after certain customization, the model can be used for solving other categories of location problems. © 2021.

abstract={Growing water demands as well as inconsistency between water demand and water supply pose new challenges for water resources managers in arid regions. This study examines the strategies to tackle water shortage for a sustainable development in Shahrood, Iran. A contentious plan has been proposed to transfer water from the Caspian Sea in north of Iran to this region. Ensuring sustainable development, however, necessitates a strategic planning for water resources. The study develops all viable strategies for the region using Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis. Due to inability of the SWOT model to rank the alternatives, the developed strategies are ranked using Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) models based on specified sustainable development criteria. The ranking is implemented using the compensatory models of Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the non-compensatory model of ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE III). The results of all MCDM models introduce water transfer as the worst strategy for the region. Because of the uncertainty in the relative importance of specified criteria, sensitivity analysis is done for MCDM models by altering the criteria weights. The results show that the ELECTRE III method has lower sensitivity than the SAW and AHP methods to changes in the weights. Also, the compensatory methods exhibits a high dependency to the weights of some dominant criteria. Therefore, this research reveals that the rankings obtained from the ELECTRE III method are more reliable for decision makers to ensure a sustainable development in the region. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The original method uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the original method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Credit rating is an assessment performed by lenders or financial institutions to determine a person's creditworthiness based on the proposed terms of the loan. Frequently, these institutions use rating models to obtain estimates for the probabilities of default for their clients (companies, organizations, government, and individuals) and to assess the risk of credit portfolios. Numerous statistical and data mining methods are used to develop such models. In this paper, the potential of a multicriteria decision-aiding approach is studied. As a first step, the proposed methodology models the problem as a multicriteria evaluation process with multiple and in some cases, conflicting dimensions, which are integrated to derive sound recommendation for DMs. The second step of the methodology involves building a multicriteria outranking model based on ELECTRE III method. An evolutionary algorithm is used to exploit the outranking model. The methodology is applied to a small-scale financial institution operating in the agricultural sector. We compare loan applications based on their attributes and the credit profile of the customer or credit applicant. Our methodology offers the flexibility of combining heterogeneous information together with the preferences of decision makers (DMs), generating both relative and fixed rules for selecting the best loan applications among new and existing customers, which is an improvement over traditional methods The results reveal that outranking models are well suited to credit rating, providing good ranking results and suitable understanding on the relative importance of the evaluation criteria. © 2017},

abstract={Territorial vulnerability and risk analysis play a fundamental role in urban planning and emergency management. Requirements analysis of such aspects are possible to define more and more effective risk mitigation strategies providing efficient response plans to events. Many mitigation strategies as well as many response plans have in common the purpose of minimizing response time in order to decrease the level of vulnerability of the concerning area. The response time to a perturbing event is in fact an essential parameter to define the hazard of the considered site and literature is unanimous in considering it. In this context, the article proposes a methodology for the optimization of the location on the territory of emergency operation centers (EOCs), reducing response times and mitigating in this way the vulnerability of the area. The proposed methodology is based on a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) hybrid type AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)-Electre. This method has been applied in the territory of Bressanone and Vipiteno (Bolzano-Italy), simulating the need to build a new barrack of Fire Department. A campaign of interviews with operators and industry experts and the collection of spatial data from the portals of the concerned authorities has been carried out in order to get the number of necessary data for the implementation of the proposed methodology. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={With the aim of making Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) more acceptable to the managers' community, the Weights Restrictions approaches were born. They allow DEA to not dispose of any data and permit the Decision Maker (DM) to have some management over the method. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a Weights Restrictions DEA model that incorporates the DM preference. In order to perform that, we employed the MACBETH methodology as a tool to find out the bounds of the weights to be used in a Weights Restrictions approach named Virtual Weights Restrictions. Our proposal achieved an outcome that has an expressive correlation with three widely used decision-aids methodologies: the ELECTRE III, the SMART and the PROMETHEE I and II. In addition, our approach was able to join the most significant outcomes of all the above three Multicriteria decisionaids methodologies in one unique outcome.},

abstract={Employees must acquire new competences and qualifications throughout their lives, in order to be able to deal with the multiple changes in the labour market. The specific knowledge and competences, acquired either formally or non-formally, must be recognized so that they can be transferred and utilized. The existing titles of studies and accreditation mechanisms do not generally cover this need. This paper aims to propose an integrated approach for the evaluation of information technology knowledge and skills, regardless of where and how they have been acquired, so as to apply a continuous education and training policy. The proposed multicriteria methodology for the evaluation of qualifications and skills concerns candidates wishing to be accredited in an information technology specialization or profession. The methodology refers to the evaluation of the professional experience, studies and vocational training of the candidates for accreditation. It contains the analysis and modelling of the qualitative criteria as well as the implementation of multicriteria aggregation-disaggregation techniques attributing value to each criterion. Then, the candidates are classified in categories of professionals using the Electre Tri method, accepting as input data the multicriteria assessments on each criterion. The proposed evaluation approach has been adapted to the Greek educational system and is applied to a specific example of candidate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

SMAA-TRI is based on Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), and it allows ELECTRE TRI to be used with imprecise, arbitrarily distributed values for weights and the lambda cutting level. The method computes for each alternative action the share of parameter values that have it assigned to different categories. We list some potential military applications.

abstract={Various methods, known as Multiple Criteria Decision Making Methods (MCDM), have been proposed to assist decision makers in the process of ranking alternatives. Given the variability of available methods, choosing an MCDM ranking method is a difficult task. There are key factors in the process of choosing an MCDM method such as: (i) available time; (ii) effort required by a given approach; (iii) importance of accuracy; (iv) transparency necessity; (v) conflict minimization necessity; and (vi) facilitator’s skill with the method. However, the problem is further increased by the knowledge that the solution of MCDM ranking methods may be sensitive to slight variations in entrance data and, in some cases, might replace the best alternative for the worst when the weightings for the criteria are changed. Some researchers have addressed this problem through different approaches, including the evaluation of MCDM ranking methods in the sense of predicting the initial rankings given by the decision maker. The objective of this study is to propose an empirical experiment to evaluate the propensity for initial ranking prediction of the principal MCDM ranking methods, namely: SAW, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE II and TODIM. The study also aimed to assess possible common ranking problems in MCDM methods, such as reversibility, found in the literature. It was found that just up to 20% of initial ranking order was predicted entirely correct by some of the methods. It was also found that just a few methods did not present internal ranking inconsistency. The results of this study and those found in the literature give a warning regarding the choice of MCDM ranking methods. It is suggested that special care must be taken in the choice of methods and, besides axiomatic comparisons, ranking comparisons could be a useful way to enhance the decision making process, since MCDM methods are tools for learning about the problem and do not prescribe solutions. © 2016 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={Ranking the risks imposed by tunneling projects is one of the most important tasks in the process of risk management. Recognizing the riskiest component enables managers to plan efficiently for adopting risk reduction measures. The first stage regarding this issue is to define the potential risky parameters and then establish an order among them. Therefore, managers always look for a reliable technique to manage the limitations of finance and time. The ELECTRE technique is a powerful method among multicriteria decision-making methods that is capable of modeling complex and sophisticated systems and sub-systems. Since the process of risk ranking is a complicated and uncertain problem, and fuzzy logic is capable of dealing with the existing uncertainty in decision-making, in this research the fuzzy ELECTRE method has been employed. To demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed model, a real-world case study, Tehran's line 7 subway project, is implemented. The results show that ’damages and accidents of machinery’ and ‘unsafe working conditions’ are located in the highest rank. Whereas, ‘delay in project completion’ and ‘failure of equipments’ are ranked as the least important components. © 2013 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management.},

For that purpose multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) methods such as ELECTRE TRI for sorting and ELECTRE III for ranking are applied in a real case-study and the results obtained are compared. The case study is a small sanitary sewer system from a Portuguese utility located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The problem to investigate is the prioritization of the sewer candidates for rehabilitation. The decision maker (a panel group of specialists) has chosen five assessment measures: water level and maximum flow velocity (hydraulic performance indices), sewer importance and failure repair cost (collapse-related consequences of failure) and the risk of collapse. The results show that the outcomes from ELECTRE III are easier to understand than those from ELECTRE TRI method. Two different sets of weights were used, and the sorting and ranking results from both methods were found to be sensitive to them. ELECTRE TRI method is not straightforward as it involves technical parameters that are difficult to de fine, such as reference profiles and cut levels. © IWA Publishing 2012.},

The two most useful approaches to aggregating individual preferences are the aggregation of individual judgments and the aggregation of individual priorities. This paper focuses on the latter approach and proposes a multicriteria group decision model in situations where there is no information with regard to the relative importance of the decision-makers. This model includes three stages. In the first, the ELECTRE II method is applied so as to obtain the individual rankings. In the second stage, a global matrix of alternatives versus decisionmakers is built up using the results from the previous stage. Finally, the third stage aggregates the individual preferences by applying the ELECTRE IV method and the final collective evaluation is undertaken. A numerical application is presented to illustrate the model.},

abstract={In this paper, a new multi-criteria decision-making procedure is presented, which captures preferential information in the form of the threshold model. It is based on the ELECTRE-like sorting analysis restricted by the localization principle, which enables high adaptability of the decision model and reduces the cognitive load imposed on the decision-makers. It lays the foundation for the introduction of three concepts that have been previously insufficiently supported by outranking methods - semiautomatic derivation of criteria weights according to the selective effects of discordance and veto thresholds, convergent group consensus seeking, and autonomous multi-agent negotiation. The interdependent principles are justified, and the methodological solutions underlying their implementation are provided. © 2008 Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.},

abstract={This investigation presents a synthesis of two multicriteria analysis methods, Rough Set Method (RSM) and Net Flow Method (NFM), applied to the multicriteria optimisation for the manufacture of paper using jack pine as the source of fibres. This work is the result of a collaboration between different Canadian and French laboratories. The two optimisation methods, based on different approaches, are applied to the same Pareto domain of non-dominated operating conditions. The Rough Set Method (RSM) uses a set of decision rules that are based on the preferences of experts, when presented with a small set of diverse conditions extracted from the Pareto domain. These rules are then applied to the entire Pareto domain to determine the preferred zone of operation. In the Net Flow Method (NFM), the preferences of experts are defined with three threshold values and one set of weights that are used to classify the entire Pareto domain. The NFM is a hybrid of two methods between ELECTRE and PROMETHEE. To compare these two methods, they were used to optimise the identical process. Results clearly show that the two methods gave nearly identical optimal solutions and well within inherent experimental errors. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most complex decision problems involve conflicting multicriteria to be reconciled. It is not uncommon that the numerical values of alternatives of some criteria are subject to imprecision, uncertainty, and indetermination. The concept of pseudo-criterion and its two thresholds allow them to be taken into account. So far, outranking relation methods, which are called ELECTRE I-IV and others, in which an outranking relation between alternatives in constructed from pseudo-criteria have been developed. Among others, ELECTRE III is the most familiar and has been widely used. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new procedure for treating the pseudo-criterion based on the ternary AHP. This procedure differs from ELECTRE III and requires only the incomplete information on the weights but not precise weights. Strict preference, weak preference, and indifference relations associated with a pseudo-criterion are formulated by a ternary comparison. In general, the procedures for dealing with the pseudo-criterion necessarily involve a certain amount of arbitrarines. Therefore, it is preferable to derive the rankings of alternatives from several procedures for the pseudo-criterion in order to promote complementary viewpoints. Comparing our procedure with ELECTRE III, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed procedure are discussed.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: A research project was undertaken for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine the relative utility and effectiveness of four well‐known multicriteria decision making (MCDM) models for applications in realistic water resources planning settings. A series of experiments was devised to examine the impact of rating and ranking procedures on the decision making behavior of users (e.g., planners, managers, analysts, etc.) when faced with situations involving multiple evaluation criteria and numerous alternative planning projects. The four MCDM models tested were MATS‐PC, EXPERT CHOICE, ARIADNE, and ELECTRE. Two groups of analysts and decision makers were tested. One group consisted of experienced U.S. Army Corps planners, while the other was comprised of graduate students. Based on a series of nonparametric statistical tests, the results identified EXPERT CHOICE as the preferred MCDM model by both groups based largely on ease of use and understandability. ARIADNE fostered the largest degree of agreement within and among the two groups of individuals tested. The tests also lend support to the claim that rankings are not affected significantly by the choice of decision maker (i.e., who uses any of these MCDM models) or which of these four models is used.

abstract={A major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water, food, and energy sectors and the resulting economic, social, and environmental consequences. Focusing on the challenges in one sector (e.g. water shortage in the water sector) and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems; rather, it will create a new problem (the decline of food production) in the food sectors. The nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water, food, and energy sectors by considering the sectors’ policies to achieve sustainable development. The present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the Yazd-Ardakan aquifer, Yazd province, Iran. For this purpose, 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public, private, semi-private and non-governmental organizations. Three types of interactions (knowledge and information exchange, budget transfer, and collaboration) were analyzed among the actors. The actor-network was, then, assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors. Then, a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level, and the power analysis was carried out using in-degree, out-degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level. Social network analysis criteria were, then, incorporated with the multi-criteria decision-making model ELECTRE I to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network. Next, the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis. According to the results, the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium. Most of the power lies with the public sector. The water, food, and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Rapid growth and development of civil engineering in recent years inspire building enterprises to concentrate on construction contractor selection for achieving more construction quality and lower construction cost. The existing studies generally regard the process of selecting the best contractor as a multi-criteria group decision making problem. Few research studies addressed the contractor selection problem in the context of large-scale group decision making, which is common in practical scenarios in terms of major construction projects as a number of experts with diverse backgrounds are usually involved. On this basis, we establish a contractor selection framework under large-scale group decision making environment, which covers expert classification, consensus reaching process, collective decision matrix generation, and the ranking-oriented decision making method. We cluster expert group with K-means clustering method based on expertise levels, which are depicted by six features generated with an expertise identification approach. The consensus model manages consensus reaching process from both intra-and interlayers and takes into account the interactions between them. After reaching agreements among experts, this paper utilizes the concept of proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set to assemble intra-subgroup assessments for the reduction of information loss or distortion. Then, an aggregation process carries on as to gather subgroup assessments in which the subgroup weights are derived from their cluster centers and sizes in the use of the TOPSIS method. Finally, the well-established decision making tool integrating qualitative and quantitative criteria, ELECTRE III, is adapted to elicit the ranking of bidders. An illustrative study and a comparative analysis are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the established multi-criteria group decision making approach. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Linguistic variables play a vital role in several qualitative decision environments, in which decision-makers assume several feasible linguistic values or criteria instead of a single term for an alternative or variable. The motivation for the use of words or sentences instead of numbers is that linguistic classification and characterizations are generally less precise than numerical ones. In this research article, we encourage the fuzzy linguistic approach and introduce the novel concept known as m-polar fuzzy linguistic variable (mFLV) to increase the affluence of linguistic variables based on m-polar fuzzy (mF) approach. An mF set is an effective concept for interpreting uncertainty and fuzziness. The concept of mFLV is more versatile and sensible for dealing with real-life problems, when data comes from qualitative and multipolar information. We also introduce an mF linguistic ELECTRE-I approach to solve multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and multiple-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems, where the evaluation of the alternatives under suitable linguistic values are determined by the decision-makers. Furthermore, we validate the efficiency of our proposed technique by applying it to real-life examples, such as the salary analysis of companies and by selecting a corrupt country. Finally, we develop an algorithm of our proposed approach, present its flow chart, and generate computer programming code. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Even small improvements in storage operations can bring significant benefits in customer response time, increasing the level of service offered. However, a company cannot offer high level of service for all products. In this sense, one of the ways used to optimize the activities for order picking is the study of storage location assignment problem (SLAP). Thus, this paper proposed a multi-criteria decision model to perform the products classification and to solve the SLAP in a multi-layer warehouse. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to define the shelf level for each product, and the ELECTRE III method is used to establish a fixed location for each product on the shelf it belongs to. The great advantage of this model is that there is not trade-off among the criteria, and it is able to consider several criteria simultaneously. However, the main goal is not optimization, but the search for a storage operations performance balance, considering multiple criteria, allowing for a better inventory management when considering profitability criteria, for example, and improvement in the order picking operations, through the demand and space required criteria. In addition, it considers the preferences of the decision maker. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={The location selection of distribution centers is one of the important strategies to optimize the logistics system. To solve this problem, under certain environment, this paper presents a new multicriteria decision-making method based on ELECTRE I. The proposed method helps decision-makers to select the best location from a given set of locations for implementing. After having identified decision-makers, the criteria, and the set of locations, the factors influencing the selection are analyzed in order to identify the best location. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to determine the influence of criteria weights on the selection decision. The strength of the proposed method is to incorporate decision-makers’ preferences into the decision-making process. In addition, the proposed method considers both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Finally, the selected solution is validated by both tests of concordance and discordance simultaneously. A case study is provided to illustrate the proposed method. © 2017 Maroi Agrebi et al.},

However, it is difficult to make a systematic and complete evaluation of their quality due to their diversity of functionalities, which makes them complex to analyse. This paper proposes the complementation of the WQI assessment system for Destination Marketing Organizations with the Multi-criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) method ELECTRE. WQI assessment system contains several indicators (123) that can be organised in a hierarchical structure, which makes suitable the application of ELECTRE-III-H. ELECTRE-III-H method is able to reveal relevant preference relations among the websites with regard to different aspects (e.g., usability, architecture or persuasiveness), being a powerful tool to detect the strong and weak points of each website. The study is illustrated with the results of a pilot test that evaluates 10 touristic destination websites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper deals with a real-world decision-aiding problem for zoning the risk of erosion, total suspended solids emissions, and ecological consequences of their transfers towards the streams. One of these consequences is the decrease of fishes into the streams in agricultural watersheds, because of the clogging of spawning areas. Given the multiple criteria nature of the problem, the originality of our research is to adapt a new decision-aiding sorting method, ELECTRE TRI-C, for identifying risk zones in rural areas, where measures must be taken. The developed model was applied in a small watershed (Low Normandy, France) where the objective was to assess the most appropriate intervention for protecting the reproduction habitat of the salmonid fishes. Agricultural parcels were evaluated on multiple criteria for grouping them into four risk categories, which are related to risk levels as well as priorities on the improvement works. The decision-aiding sorting model is co-constructed, within a constructive approach, through an interaction process between decision-aiding analysts, environmental experts, and local actors for improving transparency and communication on the results. This model is linked with a geographical information system (GIS) for assessing a set of criteria and the visualization of the farming parcels along with their type of intervention they should be submitted to best practices. The assignment results were validated by the environmental experts. These results have a strong impact on the agricultural practices of the farmers into the watersheds. The model proposed in this paper can be considered as a useful decision aid tool in any regions for implementing public agricultural and environmental policies for protecting the ecological areas. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Problems related to the management of construction projects are addressed in many studies. Falling behind schedule and being over budget are examples of bad results, due to the uncertainties and the dynamic environment of the construction process. This study proposes a decision model for helping project managers to focus on the main tasks of a project network during the life cycle of a project based on a MCDA (multiple criteria decision analysis) method. The model assigns priorities classes to activities in project management, taking into account several points of view. The model is based on the ELECTRE TRI-C method, which permits activities to be assigned to categories. As the environment is very dynamic, the model was built taking into consideration changes that may occur while a project is being carried out, and therefore the model must be reassessed during the project life cycle. Furthermore, the model supports a decision making environment where responsibilities are distributed amongst project team members and it brings the benefit of developing disciplines that lead to the team's greater effectiveness. An application of the model, based on a realistic situation, is presented in the context of a construction project in order to demonstrate the use of the model. The results show that by using the model, managers can improve their performance with regard to controlling project activities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This paper deals with the evaluation of solutions to resolve a problem of sewage sludge management in the rural municipality of Lac-Megantic. In order to develop a consensus, an advisory committee representative of the population has studied the possible solutions and has made recommendations to municipal decision-makers. A panel of experts from the Universite de Sherbrooke (STOPER research team) provided the committee with information concerning the various aspects of sewage sludge management. Four principal solutions were retained: composting, landfilling, land application and incineration. The decision model included criteria employed in the analysis of the waste management problem relying on inter-disciplinary principles: economics, technological aspects, environmental risks, human health risks and social perception. The committee members were asked to evaluate each solution on the basis of information provided by the STOPER research team by ranking each criterion of each solution. The STOPER research team developed a more detailed impact matrix by estimating several subcriteria and combinations of solutions. Three multicriteria decision-making methods (weighted sum, Electre and fuzzy set theory) were used to analyse the impact matrices obtained from the advisory committee and the STOPER research team. Monte Carlo simulations were used to take into account the uncertainties relative to the estimation of criteria and weights, and to verify the stability of potential solutions. In the present case study, all the methods show that there is a real consensus in the choice of sludge management strategies. Composting and land application represent the two most interesting and wanted solutions for the municipality. The Monte Carlo simulations show, however, that a clear preference cannot be established between these two disposal methods.},

abstract={This paper presents a new outranking method whose main feature is its capacity to handle imperfect knowledge. This research is interested in two important sources of imperfect knowledge: 1) poorly known model parameters, and 2) imperfectly known (even missing) criterion values characterizing the actions. The use of interval numbers to model imperfect knowledge is suggested, and a new interval-based outranking method is proposed as an extension of the outranking approach to the interval framework. This method handles different sources of imperfect knowledge coming from model parameters (weights, veto thresholds, majority threshold) and from ill-determined, imprecise, uncertain, arbitrary (even missing) criterion values. The index of likelihood of the interval outranking is interpreted from a logical perspective, and could be used for choice, ranking and ordinal classification. Specifically, this paper proposes the method INTERCLASS for ordinal classification, which is inspired by ELECTRE TRI-B. Their assignment rules and structural properties are similar, but INTERCLASS is able to handle imprecisions in weights, veto thresholds, cutting level, and even in criteria defining limiting profiles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, efficient management of these departments by executives and service providers is only possible with effective tools such as simulation. The concept of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) is applicable by computer simulation for decision analysis and performance evaluation of an ED. This study proposes an integration of computer simulation, MCDM methods of interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IT2FAHP), and ELECTRE for an ED system in a university hospital. Due to the high uncertainty in ED operations, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are used in MCDM process. Consequently, the integrated method can be used as a useful tool to evaluate the ED performance and select the best scenario considering different numbers of nurses and doctors for three shifts.

We first propose a new method for the construction of an intuitionistic fuzzy outranking relation to exploit a ranking problem. Then we extend the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE III method to take into account group decision techniques and develop an automatic approach to achieving group opinion satisfaction, which can avoid forcing the decision makers to modify their decision matrices.

abstract={The expected growth of living standard, number of inhabitants and development of technology, industry and agriculture will cause a significant increase of energy consumption in cities. Three scenarios of energy sector development until 2030 and corresponding energy consumption for the city of Belgrade are analyzed in this paper. These scenarios consider different level of economic development, investments in energy sector, substitution of fossil fuels, introduction of renewable energy sources and implementation of energy efficiency measures. The proposed model for selection of optimal district heating system compares different options for fulfilling expected new heat demand through eight criteria for each scenario. Proposed options are combination of different energy sources and technologies for their use. The criteria weights are set according to Serbian economy and energy position. The criteria include financial aspects, environmental impact and availability of energy. Multi-criteria method ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite) is used as a tool for obtaining the optimal option. It is concluded that combination of CHP (combined heat and power) plant and centralized use of geothermal energy is optimal choice in the optimistic scenario. In the pessimistic and business as usual scenario the optimal option is combination of new gas boilers and centralized use of geothermal energy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The CSRSS is based on the Skyline and showed some promising first results. We consider that the research and selection of a Cloud service among a set of Cloud services is a choice problem. So, in this work, we thought of using outranking methods in order to better refine the results. Our work's main contribution is conceiving an Agent that uses both the Skyline and an outranking method to determine which Cloud services meet best the users' requirements.

The high installation and operations costs of DCs and the stringent requirements regarding reliability and safety require close attention to the location of this type of facility.

For each of these main dimensions, the evaluation was formulated as a multicriteria sorting problem. These problems were analyzed using the outranking MCDA method ELECTRE TRI through the IRIS software, allowing for uncertainty about the criteria weights.

abstract={The selection of the potential sites to the creation of an agro-industrial complex requires a large amount of spatial information. Geographical information systems are capable of managing this information, providing the ability to integrate multiple layers of information and deriving new ones. This study incorporates environmental, social, economic, geological and infrastructural data. A multi-criteria analysis is performed to select the potential sites to the creation of an agro-industrial complex in the city of Sfax (the southern coast of Tunisia). The comparison by pair method adopted in this paper, based on a linear combination pondered after having assigned to every factor of decision a coefficient of level-headedness, creates many scenarios among which we selected the sustainable development one. This scenario assigned the highest weight to the economical, environmental and social factors (0. 3 for each factor), which shows the presence of nine suitable sectors for the creation of an agro-industrial complex. The ELECTRE method enabled us to make a site ordering for the identification of the most three appropriate sites. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={So far, competing forecasting models are compared to each other using a single criterion at a time, which often leads to different rankings for different criteria - a situation where one cannot make an informed decision as to which model performs best overall; that is, taking all performance criteria into account. To overcome this methodological problem, we propose to use a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based framework and discuss how one might adapt it to address the problem of relative performance evaluation of competing forecasting models. Three outranking methods have been used in our empirical experiments to rank order competing forecasting models of crude oil prices; namely, ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE I, and PROMETHEE II. Our empirical results reveal that the multidimensional framework provides a valuable tool to apprehend the true nature of the relative performance of competing forecasting models. In addition, as far as the evaluation of the relative performance of the forecasting models considered in this study is concerned, the rankings of the best and the worst performing models do not seem to be sensitive to the choice of importance weights or outranking methods, which suggest that the ranks of these models are robust. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a structured methodology to permit the optimal selection of the best-suited computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software within maintenance information technologies. Design/methodology/approach The analysis has been executed adopting a multi-attribute decision-making methodology, namely the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). For the selection process, 17 criteria under five main heading have been defined. Data obtained from questionnaires and interviews with the company's maintenance managers have been used in fuzzy TOPSIS. Findings The application of the proposed approach allows the maintenance practitioners to concentrate on a limited subset of CMMS applications and to compare their actual capabilities in order to select the right one, rather than considering only their purchase cost. Research limitations/implications Comparisons with other multi-attribute decision-making techniques such as AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and ELECTRE (elimination and choice expressing reality) under fuzzy conditions can be done for further research. Practical implications This paper is a very useful source of information both for maintenance managers and stakeholders in making decisions about the selection of CMMS software. Originality/value This paper addresses CMMS software evaluation and selection criteria for practitioners and proposes a new multi-attribute decision-making methodology, hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS, for the problem.

This paper presents a multicriteria group decision model based on ELECTRE IV and VIP Analysis methods, to those cases where there is great divergence among the decision makers. This model includes two stages. In the first, the ELECTRE IV method is applied and a collective criteria ranking is obtained. In the second, using criteria ranking, VIP Analysis is applied and the alternatives are selected. To illustrate the model, a numerical application in the context of the selection of suppliers in project management is used. The suppliers that form part of the project team have a crucial role in project management. They are involved in a network of connected activities that can jeopardize the success of the project, if they are not undertaken in an appropriate way. The question tackled is how to select service suppliers for a project on behalf of an enterprise that assists the multiple objectives of the decision-makers.},

The specific problem of the choice of a site for building a large reservoir is investigated. The problem elements consist of four actors, 13 criteria, and 38 alternatives. The first phase of the methodology, the ELECTRE III technique, is used to screen alternatives and reduce the choice set to eight "efficient" alternatives, which are then examined in some detail. In the second phase, the multiactor multicriterion decision process is modeled by means of an extension of ELECTRE III. The solutions thus obtained are compared to the outcomes of the actual decision process. The similarities and differences between the model and reality are used to assess the suitability of that approach. ©ASCE.},

abstract={Hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets have remarkable theoretical and practical features, which derive from their role as a generalization of Pythagorean fuzzy sets that embeds the benefits of hesitation. Their advantages motivate us to extend existing decision-making methods to the case where data and information are in the form of several values. We propose an ELimination and Choice Translating REality-II (ELECTRE-II) technique under hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy (HPF) information to handle diverse opinions of decision experts. The main contribution of this work is the formulation of the basic structure of an HPF ELECTRE-II method, including three kinds of outranking sets (concordance, indifferent, and discordance), two types of outranking matrices (concordance and discordance), two kinds of outranking relations (weak and strong), and two types of outranking graphs (strong and weak graphs). Further, we discuss some quantitative applications to guarantee the applicability and flexibility of the presented framework. To endorse the advantages and accuracy of HPF ELECTRE-II technique, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis with existing techniques, such as ELECTRE-II approach under hesitant fuzzy data, ELECTRE group decision-making method under fuzzy knowledge, PF ELECTRE-1, and HPF ELECTRE-II methods. Moreover, we state some important insights and discuss the limitations of the model here proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The system is based on consensus measures and it has been designed to provide advice to the decision-makers to increase group consensus level while maintaining the individual consistency of each decision-maker. It is based on the use of fuzzy outranking relations to model individual and group preferences. For the exploitation of the models—formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem and solved with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm—the system generates advice on how decision-makers should change their preferences to reach a ranking of alternatives with a high degree of consistency and consensus. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The objective of this study is to assess the performance of chemical kinetic model for heat transfer acting on the hypersonic vehicle. Four different chemical kinetic models, including Dunn Kang model, Gupta model, Park 87 model and Park 91 model, are implemented and assessed. The differences among these models are obvious, consisting of the elementary reactions, the method of evaluating backward rate coefficients and chemical kinetic rates. In order to further investigate the performance of these models for hypersonic aeroheating prediction, three typical test cases are employed: (1) the heat transfer acting on ELECTRE vehicle at Mach number 13, (2) the heat transfer acting on Apollo command module at Mach number 20.5 and (3) the heat transfer acting on Space Shuttle Orbiter at Mach number 20.985. Firstly, the behaviors of these models are demonstrated by comparing the numerical results with the flight data or experimental data in detail. Secondly, the reasons for the discrepancies of heat fluxes computed with these models are discussed. The results reveal that the heat fluxes acting on ELECTRE vehicle and the head of Space Shuttle Orbiter predicted by these chemical kinetic models are in good consistency and agree well with the flight or experimental data. With the increasing of complexity of the vehicle's geometry, the differences of heat flux, especially the peak heat flux, become more and more obvious, and the maximum difference among them may exceed 25%. The numerical results also indicate that the numerical prediction of heat transfer acting on complicated geometry exhibits a relatively strong sensitivity to the choice of chemical kinetic models.

abstract={This investigation introduces multi objective performance analysis (MOPA), a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach to solve decision problems in a supply chain. In this paper, an innovative modified weight concept is employed to modify the weights of the criteria in order to reduce the affect of the inherent inaccuracy involved with direct use of weights. Modified weight and normalized performance rating are integrated to compute modified weighted performance (MWP). Aggregate modified weighted performances (AMWP) of the alternatives are determined to evaluate benefit cost ratio (BCR) which is considered as the final selection index of the alternative. The proposed algorithm MOPA is illustrated with six real life decision problems in various stages of a supply chain to adjudge its enviable significance from the point of simplicity, feasibility and applicability. In order to ensure the compatibility, the result obtained by the proposed algorithm MOPA is compared with the proven and established MCDM methodologies TOPSIS, SAW, MOORA, ELECTRE II, and VIKOR. The comparative analysis shows that the achieved result perfectly matches with most of the cited decision problems of previous research works published in various journals. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveal that the modified weight concept reduces the relative dispersion of weights significantly, leads to precise decision. Sensitivity analysis (SA) and other investigations also find MOPA as a simple, robust, effective and precise decision making tool. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Summary Next generation wireless networks consist of many heterogeneous access technologies that should support various service types with different quality of service (QoS) constraints, as well as user, requirements and provider policies. Therefore, the need for network selection mechanisms that consider multiple factors must be addressed. In this paper, a network selection method is proposed by applying the analytic network process to estimate the weights of the selection criteria, as well as a fuzzy version of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to perform the ranking of network alternatives. The method is applied to a heterogeneous network environment providing different QoS classes and policy characteristics. Each user applies the method to select the most appropriate network, which satisfies his or her requirements in respect of his or her service-level agreement (SLA). Performance evaluation shows that when the user requests only one service, the proposed method performs better compared to the original technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, as well as the Fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE method. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied in cases where a user requires multiple services simultaneously on a device. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed method shows that it can be properly adjusted to conform to network environment changes. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Many real-life problems are multi-objective by nature that requires evaluation of more than one criterion, therefore MCDM has become an important issue. In recent years, many MCDM methods have been developed; the existing approaches have been improved and extended. Multi criteria decision analysis has been regarded as a suitable set of methods to perform sustainability evaluations. Among numerous MCDM methods developed to solve real-life decision problems, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) continues to work satisfactorily in diverse application areas. In this paper, a novel sorting method (TOPSIS-Sort) based on the classic TOPSIS method is presented. In the TOPSIS-Sort approach an outranking relation is used for sorting purposes. The proposed approach uses characteristic profiles for defining the classes and outranking relation as the preference model. Application of the proposed approach is demonstrated by classifying 22 districts of Tehran into five classes (but none of the districts fits into Classes 4 and 5), representing areas with different levels of environmental quality. An analysis and assessment of the environmental conditions in Tehran helps to identify the districts with the poor environmental quality. Priority should be given to these areas to maintain and improve the quality of environment. The results obtained by the TOPSIS-Sort give credence to its success, because the results of sorting confirm our and specialists’ evaluation of the districts. This research provides appropriate results with respect to the development of sorting models in the form of outranking relations. The model, proposed by this study, is applicable to the other outranking methods such as ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, etc. © 2016, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The real-world economic conditions have inevitably forced many companies to pursue outsourcing as a suitable long term planning tool to reduce operating costs and improve their competitiveness in different marketplaces. One of the critical activities for outsourcing success is the outsourcing provider selection, which may be regarded as a type of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this study, we propose a multiple-criteria group decision making model under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment to select the best outsourcing provider. First, an IVIF-weighted geometric averaging (IVIFWGA) operator is employed to aggregate all individual IVIF-decision matrices provided by a group of experts into a collective IVIF-decision matrix. Then, a new version of ELECTRE method in an IVIF environment by novel indexes is proposed for the evaluation process in terms of insufficient and inaccurate information. Finally, to demonstrate its usefulness, an application example for evaluating of outsourcing providers is given from the recent literature. © 2015,Academy of Economic Studies, All right reserved.},

abstract={The primary photovoltaic (PV) system investment decision-making criteria are economics. These criteria are focused on system efficiency and cost, which is reasonable in the context of generous financial support schemes. However, when financial support is phased out, the PV market becomes technologically diversified. Environmental concerns and other qualitative issues become significant, whereas efficiency and costs may fail to describe PV systems properly. This study presents the first application of outranking techniques for PV technologies within an overall framework that includes qualitative, economic, technical and environmental criteria. The multi-criteria analysis method, ELECTRE III, identifies optimal investment decisions from a pre-determined set of investment alternatives. A case study based on a grid-connected household PV system in the United Kingdom illustrates the methodology. The results suggest emerging excitronic PV technologies such as organic PV to lead the ranking when compared with inorganic technologies. These results have to be taken in the context of a number of assumptions and estimates as well as free market, no financial support schemes and promising future technology developments. The overall decision-making framework provides comprehensive mathematical evaluations that assist PV owners, policy makers and the business community decide on technology, financial support schemes or business strategies. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

abstract={Construction and demolition waste (C&DW) constitutes a priority waste stream in the European waste strategy due to its large volume and its high recycling and reuse potential. The increase in the C&DW generation experienced during the last decades has meant a driving force to more sustainable management options. In this way, specific legislation for this waste stream has been developed such as Directive 2008/98/EC which set a target of 70% of reuse, recycling and material recovery of the C&DW by 2020. In order to fulfill this recycling target, recycling facilities needs to be properly located. Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) is a powerful tool frequently used in environmental decision-making problems which integrates the different points of view of the involved stakeholders. In this work, a methodology based in Multicriteria Analysis with the aim of locating C&DW recycling facilities has been developed and applied to a real-life case in Cantabria, a northern Spanish region. The region has been divided in geographical areas in which different alternative locations for recycling facilities have been assessed. One of these geographical areas was evaluated and a compromise solution based on economic, environmental and social criteria has been provided by Definite 3.0 MCA software. Four multicriteria analysis methods: Evamix (EV), Weighted Summation (WS), Electre II (E2) and Regime (REG) have been performed in order to obtain the most suitable locations. Analyses of the sensitivity and uncertainty of the results have been also carried out in order to investigate the robustness of the solutions obtained. Therefore, the main findings of this research have showed the applicability of the proposed MCA-based methodology to select optimal locations of C&DW recycling facilities.},

abstract={Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. These decisions are difficult because the complexity of the system or because of determining the optimal situation or behaviour. This work will illustrate how MCDA is applied in practice to a complex problem to resolve such us soil erosion and degradation. Desertification is a global problem and recently it has been studied in several forums as ONU that literally says: "Desertification has a very high incidence in the environmental and food security, socioeconomic stability and world sustained development". Desertification is the soil quality loss and one of FAO's most important preoccupations as hunger in the world is increasing. Multiple factors are involved of diverse nature related to: natural phenomena (water and wind erosion), human activities linked to soil and water management, and others not related to the former. In the whole world this problem exists, but its effects and solutions are different. It is necessary to take into account economical, environmental, cultural and sociological criteria. A multi-criteria model to select among different alternatives to prepare an integral plan to ameliorate or/and solve this problem in each area has been elaborated taking in account eight criteria and five alternatives. Six sub zones have been established following previous studies and in each one the initial matrix and weights have been defined to apply on different criteria. Three multicriteria decision methods have been used for the different sub zones: ELECTRE, PROMETHEE and AHP. The results show a high level of consistency among the three different multicriteria methods despite the complexity of the system studied. The methods are fully described for La Estrella sub zone, indicating election of weights, Initial Matrixes, algorithms used for PROMETHEE, and the Graph of Expert Choice showing the AHP results. A brief schema of the actions recommended for each of the six different sub zones is discussed. © Author(s) 2010.},

Two reference profiles are used to define the limits of three categories associated with three increasing priority levels. With these two reference profiles, applying the ELECTRE TRI method to an asset stock (a set of pipes that are candidates for rehabilitation) means assigning each pipe to one of six possible priority groups.

Indoor air flow induced by an actual Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning system was experimentally studied under various conditions. The attention was focused on thermal comfort, acoustical comfort and indoor air distribution by considering spatial statistic studies of comfort indices. The compounded electric power of fan, compressor and pumps was measured in order to get information about energy consumption. A first analysis of these parameters showed that indoor comfort cannot be described by a general law. Thus, to reach the objective of a global approach of comfort by a spatial statistical study of the various discomforts, a multi-criteria analysis based on ELECTRE II method adapted to the comfort of air-conditioned indoor environment was applied. In this way the operating rules for coherent air conditioning systems can be defined, with a requirement for quality of indoor environment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents the application of the multicriteria decision-making methods ELECTRE-I and AHP to a layout alternatives decision for a new high-speed train for the Madrid-Valencia high-speed line. The official choice is presented as a first introduction with the planning decision of the corresponding new high-speed lines for the south-east of Spain as part of the 2002-2007 high-speed network plan for Spain. This official selection of layout alternatives was decided in January 2002. The data used by the authors were obtained from public reports and official surveys, including two cost-effectiveness studies in net present value format for that part of the network that includes the important link between Madrid and Valencia. A short analysis of these net present value studies follows, and these studies show the feasibility of that part of the network, but were not decisive for the decision of the layout choice. The selection of alternatives for the Madrid-Valencia corridor is academically considered first with an ELECTRE-I method, and then with an analytic hierarchic process method. This is followed by an analysis of the problems using compromise programming. With both multicriteria decision-making methods the results showed that the North option was preferable, or 'outranked' the others, in agreement with the official selection.

abstract={The core aim of this paper is to provide a new multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) model, namely bipolar fuzzy ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) II method, by combining the bipolar fuzzy set with ELECTRE II technique. It can be used to solve the problems having bipolar uncertainty. The proposed method is established by defining the concept of bipolar fuzzy strong, median and weak concordance as well as discordance sets and indifferent set to define two types of outranking relations, namely strong outranking relation and weak outranking relation. The normalized weights of criteria, which may be partly or completely unknown for decision makers, are calculated by using an optimization technique, which is based on maximizing deviation method. A systematic iterative procedure is applied to strongly outrank as well as weakly outrank graphs to determine the ranking of favorable actions or alternatives or to choose the best possible solution. The implementation of the proposed method is presented by numerical examples such as selection of business location and to chose the best supplier. A comparative analysis of proposed ELECTRE II method is also presented with already existing multiple-attribute decision making methods, including Technique for the Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELECTRE I under bipolar fuzzy environment by solving the problem of business location. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In supply chain literature, supplier evaluation and selection problem is one of the most studied subjects because of the significant roles of suppliers in terms of the chain's sustainability and profitability. Therefore, it is important for organizations to adopt a systematic way to evaluate and select the best supplier according to their respective criteria in today's competitive environment. Multicriteria decision-making methods provide for this need of organizations because determination of an appropriate supplier selection is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem essentially. Although a lot of applications of these methods for supplier evaluation and selection can be seen in the literature, studies in the health-care sector are insufficient. Hospitals in the health-care sector also have to consider their supplier-related decisions to decrease risks and threads which affect their effectiveness. The aim of this study was to fill this gap by providing different hybrid models for selecting the best supplier for hospitals. Supplier evaluation and selection process start with recognizing the related criteria according to the studies in the literature. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is deployed to weight the criteria, and suppliers are listed via technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), elimination and choice translating reality English (ELECTRE), grey relational analysis (GRA), and simple additive weighting (SAW) methods. The main aim of this study was to present different hybrid MCDM methods and show their efficiency and consistency with each other. In this study, hybrid multicriteria decision-making models (AHP-TOPSIS, AHP-ELECTRE, AHP-GRA, and AHP-SAW) are presented and compared. The results show that the presented hybrid methods in this study are consistent with each other and give the same ranking for the selection of the best supplier. It can be considered as a useful guideline for hospitals. © 2019 Serap Akcan and Meral Güldeş.},

abstract={We present a group decision making framework for evaluating sustainability of the insulating materials. We tested thirteen materials on a model that was applied to retrofit a traditional rural building through roof’s insulation. To evaluate the materials from the socio-economic and environmental viewpoints, we combined life cycle costing and assessment with an adaptive comfort evaluation. In this way, the performances of each coating material were measured in terms of an incurred reduction of costs and consumption of resources, maintenance of the cultural and historic significance of buildings, and a guaranteed indoor thermal comfort. The comprehensive assessment of the materials involved their assignment to one of the three preference-ordered sustainability classes. For this purpose, we used a multiple criteria decision analysis approach that accounted for preferences of a few tens of rural buildings’ owners. The proposed methodological framework incorporated an outranking-based preference model to compare the insulating materials with the characteristic class profiles while using the weights derived from the revised Simos procedure. The initial sorting recommendation for each material was validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis that combined the preferences of individual stakeholders either at the output or at the input level. The analysis revealed that the most favorable materials in terms of their overall sustainability were glass wool, hemp fibres, kenaf fibres, polystyrene foam, polyurethane, and rock wool. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={The purpose of this research paper is to develop a framework to analyze the operational performance of cellular mobile telephone service providers (CMTSP) in the Delhi working area, India. Delhi area has the highest teledensity in India. The present study uses a fuzzy ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) approach to compare the performance of cellular mobile telephone service providers. The data for the analysis have been taken from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), April–June 2015. Most of the data vary from one month to another. Therefore, these small ranges of variation in the data are incorporated in this study using the fuzzy number. Total six major telecom service providers are considered in this analysis. The findings of the study suggest that the performances of Airtel and Reliance communications are in the first rank; Vodafone and Idea are in the second rank; Aircel is in the third rank, and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) is outranked by all the other service providers. The performance is analyzed on the basis of three major parameters consisting six criteria, i.e. network availability (Base Transceiver Station accumulated downtime), connection accessibility (call setup success rate, channel congestion, and traffic channel congestion), and connection retainability (call drop rate and connection with good voice quality). It has been observed that MTNL is outranked due to the highest traffic channel congestion and highest call drop rate. Using this framework, a decision maker can develop a strategy to improve the performance by benchmarking operational parameters. The research analysis is limited to only GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) service providers in the Delhi working area, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, and Gurgaon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper proposes a robustness analysis based on Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). The ensuing model was used to assess the implementation of green chemistry principles in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Its recommendations were also compared to an earlier developed model for the same purpose to investigate concordance between the models and potential decision support synergies. A three-phase procedure was adopted to achieve the research objectives. Firstly, an ordinal ranking of the evaluation criteria used to characterize the implementation of green chemistry principles was identified through relative ranking analysis. Secondly, a structured selection process for an MCDA classification method was conducted, which ensued in the identification of Stochastic Multi-Criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Lastly, the agreement of the classifications by the two MCDA models and the resulting synergistic role of decision recommendations were studied. This comparison showed that the results of the two models agree between 76% and 93% of the simulation set-ups and it confirmed that different MCDA models provide a more inclusive and transparent set of recommendations. This integrative research confirmed the beneficial complementary use of MCDA methods to aid responsible development of nanosynthesis, by accounting for multiple objectives and helping communication of complex information in a comprehensive and traceable format, suitable for stakeholders and/or decision-makers with diverse backgrounds. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={In the last decade, the nutritional and health benefits of Opuntia (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill.) were discussed by academic scientists and private companies. In particular, the introduction of this substance in frequently consumed foods, like, for example, pasta and bakery products, could have a wide diffusion due to its rich composition in polyphenols, vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids. The identified natural cactus compounds are responsible for biologically relevant activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, and neuro-protective properties. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the best combination of Opuntia quantity and process parameters (recipe) for the production of sustainable functional pasta. The results obtained show that the new functional pasta guarantees the presence of the Opuntia quantity necessary to be considered a healthy food without altering the organoleptic and physical properties of the final product. An important indicator of a sustainable food product is its capacity to contribute to public health while maintaining a high quality of the final product. The selection of the optimal recipe was carried out by means of a multi-criteria decision-making procedure, ELECTRE III. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the obtained solutions varying the ELECTRE III thresholds, showing that the results obtained are stable under uncertain conditions. Food productions are often affected by qualitative judgments in terms of physical and organoleptic properties of the final product, making the ELECTRE III particularly suitable in an industrial application in which different points of view are involved. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Many key performance indicators (KPIs) can be used for measuring maintenance performance. Companies must implement a suitable set of KPIs to measure the performance of maintenance services and the influence of practices implemented in their activities. Establishing a useful set of maintenance KPIs depends on a company's maintenance objectives and is highly related to specific business contexts, strategies, processes, and systems. Maintenance managers deal with the complex tasks of finding the best performance indicators that can help them to achieve goals. This paper presents a new approach to selecting relevant maintenance KPIs using a methodology based on the original ELECTRE I, which is a multi-criteria decision making method. The proposed methodology, which involves decision maker's preference information, determines a ranking of possible alternatives following its evaluation according to important criteria. To validate the methodology, a case study is presented. The results show that this methodology is an effective tool to aid maintenance managers in accurate KPI selection tasks according to maintenance objectives and strategies. The proposed methodology makes the decision process more explicit, rational, and efficient. © 2014 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management.},

Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis is an optimisation technique which is applied to identify the most preferred alternative under multiple criteria. In this paper, some MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, SAW, GRA and MOORA have been used to determine the best location. Finally, an outranking MCDM approach (ELECTRE-I) is applied to find an appropriate plant location. The applied complete ranking MCDM methods are considered as the criteria and the evaluated values are taken as the performance of the decision matrix. By using these elements the ELECTRE-I method has been applied. A numerical example is taken to demonstrate the procedural steps of MCDM methods for selecting the best alternative for service facility or factory location.

abstract={The role of indicators to measure trends in every area of interest is increasing. Especially in the field of politics and sociology, where modeling based on multiple indicators typically is difficult, multi-indicator systems call for attention. Multi-indicator systems are most often the first step to derive a ranking indicator. Correspondingly there is a high interest in how to transform multi-indicator systems into a one-dimensional metric scale. The scientific discipline of decision support systems provides many well-known techniques, classical examples are PROMETHEE, ELECTRE, DEA or the simple TOPSIS. The mathematical technique is pretty sophisticated, therefore the simplest variant, namely the weighted sum of indicators plays its role too, just because of its simplicity and transparency. Although the need of a derivation of a one-dimensional scale is evident, we argue that there is an interim step, between the multi-indicator system and the ranking index, provided by simple elements of partial order theory. This interim step bears useful information too and in this paper we show how and which useful additional information can be derived. We derive for example a bias-free sensitivity study, where the indicator "chronic and sustained human flight" turns out to be the most important indicator within the multi-indicator system of 12 indicators, which are the basis of the Failed State Index. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The paper is about portfolio selection in a non-Markowitz way, involving uncertainty modeling in terms of a series of meaningful quantiles of probabilistic distributions. Considering the quantiles as evaluation criteria of the portfolios leads to a multiobjective optimization problem which needs to be solved using a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) method. The primary method we propose for solving this problem is an Interactive Multiobjective Optimization (IMO) method based on so-called Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). IMO-DRSA is composed of two phases: computation phase, and dialogue phase. In the computation phase, a sample of feasible portfolio solutions is calculated and presented to the Decision Maker (DM). In the dialogue phase, the DM indicates portfolio solutions which are relatively attractive in a given sample; this binary classification of sample portfolios into ‘good’ and ‘others’ is an input preference information to be analyzed using DRSA; DRSA is producing decision rules relating conditions on particular quantiles with the qualification of supporting portfolios as ‘good’; a rule that best fits the current DM’s preferences is chosen to constrain the previous multiobjective optimization in order to compute a new sample in the next computation phase; in this way, the computation phase yields a new sample including better portfolios, and the procedure loops a necessary number of times to end with the most preferred portfolio. We compare IMO-DRSA with two representative MCDA methods based on traditional preference models: value function (UTA method) and outranking relation (ELECTRE IS method). The comparison, which is of methodological nature, is illustrated by a didactic example. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Optimum spinning machine parameters selection among available alternatives with different significances is a difficult task in textile industry. To overcome disadvantages associated with statistical methods that are used in such kind of problems, multi-criteria decision making approaches (MCDM) were employed by researchers. TOPSIS, AHP-TOPSIS and ELECTRE are three popular techniques in spinning problems. VIKOR, the Serbian name; Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje, means multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution is a novel approach that has priority over other MCDM methods in terms of precision in final ranking. In this study, selecting the appropriate doffing tube components and its adjustment for 30Ne rotor spun yarn that is intended to be used for weft-knitted fabric will be provided by this approach. Yarn samples were spun considering three variables namely, the distance between the nozzle and rotor, the extractive nozzle and the draw-off tube. Feasible alternatives were ranked on the basis of the yarn quality parameters by the VIKOR and the best alternative for increasing weft-knitting machine efficiency was introduced. According to the final ranking, the spinning condition in which the sample was spun using a spiral nozzle, a doffing tube without a torque stop and a closer setting had the highest performance. © 2012 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Netherlands.},

abstract={The purpose of stock portfolio selection is how to allocate the capital to a large number of stocks in order to bring a most profitable return for investors. In most of past literatures, experts considered the portfolio of selection problem only based on past crisp or quantitative data. However, many qualitative and quantitative factors will influence the stock portfolio selection in real investment situation. It is very important for experts or decision-makers to use their experience or knowledge to predict the performance of each stock and make a stock portfolio. Because of the knowledge, experience, and background of each expert are different and vague, different types of 2-tuple linguistic variable are suitable used to express experts' opinions for the performance evaluation of each stock with respect to criteria. According to the linguistic evaluations of experts, the linguistic TOPSIS and linguistic ELECTRE methods are combined to present a new decision-making method for dealing with stock selection problems in this paper. Once the investment set has been determined, the risk preferences of investor are considered to calculate the investment ratio of each stock in the investment set. Finally, an example is implemented to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method.},

abstract={Pharmaceuticals are omnipresent in waste-water world-wide. Research has shown that many pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during wastewater treatment, and as a result, this has led to their occurrence being reported in waste water treatment plant effluents, rivers and lakes, and more rarely in groundwater and in drinking water. Hence, it is only logical that pharmaceutical residues in the environment and their potential toxic effects have been recognized as one of the emerging research areas in environmental chemistry. A lack of data, especially ecotoxicological and fate data on pharmaceuticals, is evident. The extent to which data are missing should therefore be looked upon in more detail in order to trigger further political steps in performing studies concerning the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in the environment. In this investigation, we evaluate the data-availability of 16 pharmaceuticals in 17 Internet databases which means we examine a 16 (objects) x 17 (attributes) data-matrix. The consideration of the chosen pharmaceutical in databases is coded 0 = not available, or 1 = available. For the evaluation of the data-matrix, we apply the multi-criteria decision method named METEOR (Method of Evaluation by Order Theory). In contrast to conventional multi-criteria decision aids, like the wellknown PROMETHEE, AHP, SMART, ORESTE as well as different versions of ELECTRE, we support the basic consideration of environmetrics: let first the data speak and let us then include subjective preferences in order to get a unique decision. The basis of METEOR is a data-matrix in which the objects are characterized by a set of attributes (indicators). By means of the attributes, a partial order is derived. In the subsequent steps, attributes are aggregated by a weighting procedure, allowing a high degree of involvement of experts, stakeholders and other participants. All conducted approaches show that the data-situation on the chosen test-set of 16 well-known and highly produced pharmaceuticals is far from being satisfactory. For the two well-known pharmaceuticals roxithomycin (antibiotic) and diatrizoate (contrast media), the data-situation is extremely bad, independent of how the weighting is performed. The dataavailability for diatrizoate is a little better. The best data coverage is detected for the chemicals carbamazepine, diazepam, ethinyl estradiol, 5-fluorouracil, and phenazone. The issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment and the unavailability of data necessitate much closer communication between science and medical healthcare and politicians in the future. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={Since the transposition of the 1985 E.C. Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment into Irish law in 1988, it has been the experience that complex Environmental Impact Statements, produced to help decide the best option from a range of alternatives, often contain large volumes of information on the relevant impacts, but make relatively little effort to organise this information into a decision assisting framework that enables the relative merits of the options to be directly compared. The paper details the practical application of the ELECTRE decision-aid system to two Environmental Appraisals carried out recently in the Republic of Ireland. The two case studies illustrate how the ELECTRE framework takes complex information from an Environmental Impact Statement and uses it to rank the various project alternatives considered. © 1996 opa (overseas publishers association) amsterdam b.v.

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to propose a comprehensive framework among Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for analyzing the Information Facilitated Product Recovery System (IFPRS) on the basis of feedback captured from the industry experts and researchers. Design/methodology/approach: Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) methodology interspersed with fuzzy MICMAC is used to extract the interrelationships and develop a hierarchical structure among the identified KPIs. Further, the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) method has been enforced to determine the intensity of these relationships and identify the most influential KPIs among identified KPIs from literature review and expert opinions. The outcome indicates that “information sharing,” “technology capacity” and “technology standards such as EDI, RFID” are the KPIs that have attained highest driving power. Findings: This study has identified 15 KPIs of IFPRS and developed an integrated model using TISM and the fuzzy MICMAC approach, which is helpful to describe and organize the important KPIs and reveal the direct and indirect effects of each KPI on the IFPRS implementation. The integrated approach is developed, as the TISM model provides only binary relationship among KPIs, while fuzzy MICMAC analysis provides explicit analysis related to driving and dependence power of KPIs. Research limitations/implications: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis can be performed based on the adequate number of responses collected using structured questionnaire. More qualitative techniques like ELECTRE, TOPSIS, etc. can be used to establish the strength of relationship among the KPIs and ranking them to focus on the few critical KPIs. Practical implications: The proposed modeling could empower various governmental and non-governmental regulatory bodies in formulation of policies to effectively tackle the problem related to product recovery systems. This study has strong practical implications, for both practitioners as well as academicians. The practitioners need to concentrate on identified KPIs more cautiously during IFPRS implementation in their organizations and the top management could formulate strategy for implementing these KPIs obtained. Originality value: There is a lack of studies related to the modeling of KPIs of IFPRS. As vast information is essential about the products returned during different product recovery stages, this study bridges the gap in literature by providing a framework for KPIs related to IFPRS. It is expected that the results originated will assist the experts to relevantly identify the significant and drop insignificant KPI for successful product recovery implementation and performance improvement of IFPRS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic review on the application of different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in solving the site selection problem across multiple problem domains. The domains are energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. This study aims to answer the following research questions: Which evaluating criteria were used for each site selection problem domain? Which MCDM methods were frequently applied in a particular site selection problem domain? Design/methodology/approach: The goals of the systematic review were to identify the evaluating criteria as well as the MCDM method used for each problem domain. A total of 81 recent papers (2014–2018) including 32 papers published in conference proceedings and 49 journal articles from various databases including IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Springer, Taylor and Francis as well as ScienceDirect were evaluated. Findings: This study has shown that site selection for energy generation facilities is the most active site selection problem domain, and that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is the most commonly used MCDM method for site selection. For energy generation, the criteria which were most used were geographical elements, land use, cost and environmental impact. For logistics, frequently used criteria were geographical elements and distance, while for public services population density, supply and demand, geographical layout and cost were the criteria most used. Criteria useful for retail facilities were the size (space) of the store, demographics of the site, the site characteristics and rental of the site (cost). Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to reviewing papers which were published in the years 2014–2018 only, and only covers the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. Practical implications: MCDM is a viable tool to be used for solving the site selection problem across the domains of energy generation, logistics, public services and retail facilities. The usage of MCDM continues to be relevant as a complement to machine learning, even as data originating from embedded IoT devices in built environments becomes increasingly Big Data like. Originality/value: Previous systematic review studies for MDCM and built environments have either focused on studying the MCDM techniques itself, or have focused on the application of MCDM for site selection in a single problem domain. In this study, a critical review of MCDM techniques used for site selection as well as the critical criteria used during the MCDM process of site selection was performed on four different built environment domains. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={While eco-economy policy drives green building technologies (GBTs)innovation for the development of urban green building, GBTs innovation is still plagued with various barriers. Although many studies have examined the issues on GBTs innovation, few have specifically conducted on partner selection for GBTs innovation. This study not only proposed a criteria framework based on niche theory for niche-fitness evaluation, but also developed a novel niche field model for the selecting management of GBTs innovation partner based on field theory. First, fuzzy set theory is used to obtain the cooperation aspiration of academic research institutes according to the criteria framework. Moreover, fuzzy prospect theory is introduced to help construction enterprises avoid risks blindly or like risks, so that decision-making is more reasonable. Second, the combined method of VIKOR method and improved ELECTRE method considering compensatory and non-compensatory decision rules is coupled with the criteria weight calculated by entropy measure method to evaluate the niche-fitness of academic research institutes. Furthermore, a novel niche field model considering resource complementarity is developed to select a best academic research institute. Finally, the results of a case study shows that the criteria framework and the niche field model can be applied to real-world partner selection for GBTs innovation and yield selecting results that are more realistic. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on niche strength and degree of niche overlap for niche-fitness evaluation, and innovation ability, trust and communication degree, and compatibility level are reasonably incorporated into the theoretical framework. Moreover, this study also theoretically expends the applications of field theory considering resource complementarity with fuzzy linguistic information in collaborative innovation paradigm. In addition, this study can help construction enterprises select their GBT innovation partners from the masses of academic research institutes, and thereby promote GBTs innovation activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

But vendor selection is a complex, multi-criteria decision-making process because different and conflicting criteria have to be considered and assessed in order to find consistent suppliers. Consequently, evaluating and selecting the best vendor is the key to successful business. Traditionally, vendors are normally selected on the basis of traditional criteria (TC), such as costs and quality, neglecting resilience criteria (RC) (e.g. agility and flexibility). Thus, enterprises ultimately realize that a selecting method which involves TC as the only ones is inefficient and needs to be changed. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This study was set in motion by a problem in practice. It aims to provide a user-friendly decision-making tool for selecting the best vendor from a group which submitted their tenders for implementing a proposed radio frequency identification (RFID)-based passport tracking system (Dukyil et al., 2017). The main traditional and resilience (“trasilience” henceforth) selection criteria were identified in a unified framework in collaboration with experts in the institution. Next, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) algorithm was used to determine the relative importance of each criterion and the weights thus obtained were integrated into the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) algorithm. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm was also applied, to evaluate the performance of vendors and to select the best one. The qualitative evaluation of the criteria and the vendors was based on four decision makers. Finally, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) approach was applied to obtain the statistical difference between the ranking orders obtained from the two algorithms. Findings: The efficiency of the proposed decision-making tool was evident from the real-case study of six tenders submitted for implementing a RFID-based passport tracking system. The SRCC also turned out a “very strong” association value between TOPSIS and ELECTRE. Practical implications: The developed trasilient decision-making tool can easily be used to solve similar vendor or supplier selection problem. Moreover, other criteria can be added to fit other cases. Later, the tool was made available to the institution under study for solving future evaluation problems. Originality/value: The literature shows that none of the previous papers presented an integrated trasilient approach that considers RC and TC simultaneously. This study presents a new trasilience tool for selecting a vendor. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Resilience in the context of supply chains has received particular attention over recent years. Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers’ preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance. The results show that the proposed method is suitable and useful as a decision aiding tool for purchasing decisions, allowing managers to obtain robust conclusions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Frequent food safety incidents caused widespread consumer concerns. Even though food safety is one of the weakest links in the fresh food supply chain and influences consumer food choice in ways different from the quality dimension, this factor is hardly proposed as one of the key traditional supplier selection criteria (e.g. quality, delivery, and price) in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to develop a business process decision model to assess the non-compensating food safety sub-criteria in order to disqualify fresh food suppliers that cannot reach the minimum threshold for low probable food safety failure. The preferred fresh food suppliers can minimize the risk of food safety failure and the associated huge food safety failure costs spanning from private consumer anguish to social distress that cause unbearable costs of sales loss and damage to brand image in business. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a novel approach that combines several well-established multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, including fuzzy AHP (FAHP), TOPSIS, and ELECTRE, and innovatively apply to analyze supplier performance and prioritize potential fresh food suppliers. This hybrid business process model can enforce compliance to all the five non-compensatory sub-criteria of food safety. Since ELECTRE is a non-compensatory MCDM method, it is therefore particularly applicable for disqualifying high risk fresh food suppliers from further full scale supplier performance evaluation by FAHP and TOPSIS. This hybrid business process decision model is able to capitalize on the strengths of these MCDM methods and offset their deficiencies. Findings: This study uses data of an international supermarket chain to validate feasibility of the proposed model. Results indicate that this model is able to assess the non-compensating food safety sub-criteria via the ELECTRE method in order to disqualify fresh food suppliers that cannot reach the minimum threshold for low probable food safety failure. Only the preferred suppliers with the required food safety capability can proceed to the second stage of the supplier selection process. Assessment via the TOPSIS method reveals the ranking order of those top performing suppliers according to their relative scores along all the supplier selection criteria. The TOPSIS ranking results with the selection of the suppliers C, E, A, and F are robust and consistent across all the different scenarios. Practical implications: Application to the fresh food industry is possible with the aid of the MCDM methods. The contribution to the body of knowledge in this teaching and research field demonstrates the importance of first identifying the order qualifier for disqualifying those suppliers that do not satisfy the food safety requirements via the ELECTRE method. The proposed assessment procedure complies with the regulatory policy on food safety, and would influence public policy in applying the best practice of food safety regulation. Without first qualifying the potential suppliers on the basis of food safety, wrong decision can be made to select those high food risk suppliers that have relatively higher overall scores in other supplier selection criteria. Using the assessment results has positive economic and commercial impact on the purchasing managers to formulate appropriate purchasing and supplier development strategy to enhance supplier’s food safety performance, whilst maximizing the overall supplier portfolio performance. The improved supplier’s food safety performance will certainly benefit the society’s quality of life as well. Originality/value: Based on the analytical MCDM methods of FAHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE, purchasing managers can operationalize the Hill’s framework of order qualifier and winner that has primarily been used in the literature and manufacturing industry. This study represents the first move to innovatively apply the FAHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE methods to operationalize the Hill’s framework of order qualifier and winner that has primarily been used in the literature and manufacturing industry. Application to the fresh food industry to validate the feasibility of the proposed model has been conceived and implemented in this study. Analysis of the data inputs of a supermarket chain via the three MCDM methods generate the results that fulfill the purpose of achieving the research objective of identifying and managing the supplier base that can deliver the best supplier performance, conditional on first passing the fresh food safety test. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The successful delivery of organisational objectives is significantly linked to the effective collection of project portfolios. There are many different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods available which can be used to calculate examine and select project portfolio management (PPM) decision options. However, finding the most suitable one is a challenging task which requires a constructive review and comparison of existing PPM MCDM approaches. This study identifies the strengths and weaknesses of MCDM methods for assisting in PPM decision making. Of more than 100 methods identified in more than 1,400 publications, eight [analytic hierarchy process (AHP), analytic network process (ANP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE), preference-ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR)] that best suit PPM are down-selected and compared. Although none is ideally suited for the application to portfolio management, two standard ones (AHP and DEA) are shown to be the most suitable and are recommended for the further investigation and validation. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Photovoltaic (PV) system decision making techniques have traditionally been based on a single economic criterion. However, to properly address global and regional targets for green energy economy, it is necessary to consider a myriad of criteria including environmental implications. A global range of existing or emerging financial support policies should be considered, presenting a complex mathematical problem across several stakeholders to decide where, what and when to invest. This paper presents a multi-criteria framework to evaluate the impact of different financial support policies on their attractiveness for domestic PV systems deployment on a multinational level. The paper also reviews historic cumulative PV installation under certain studied financial policies, and brings the framework output into this discussion related to evident effectiveness of these policies. The paper highlights the policies that have the potential to encourage rapid deployment of PV systems which in turn may facilitate sufficient investments to several stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recently, hub location problems have become more common with successful applications in air transportation. In this paper, we consider a hub-location and routing problem for border (Borders in this work refer to land borders, unless otherwise stated.) security in Turkey. Security is currently one of the most important issues. Countries are spending large amounts to prevent threats that may come from neighboring countries. Land borders are required to be monitored because of illegal border crossing activities and terrorist attacks. Various geographical restrictions at the borders can cause difficulties in monitoring and gathering the required data. We focus on selecting hubs among the airports run by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority of Turkey, the assignment of demand points to hubs and determining optimal routes for each hub. The study consists of two stages. First, the single allocation p-hub median problem is solved to determine the locations of the hubs for unmanned aircraft. To select hubs, the decision model uses an appropriateness parameter that is obtained by using ELECTRE, a multi-criteria decision-making tool. Five criteria are considered: The type of airport, the remoteness from threats, the proximity to a land border, the aerodrome traffic density and the time that the possible hubs are open to the air traffic. In the second stage, optimal routes are determined for each hub by using two mathematical models. The first model is cost-oriented and there is one vehicle per hub. In the second mathematical model for routing, the monitoring frequency parameters which means the priority of monitoring of the demand nodes obtained by using ELECTRE are used to maximize the monitoring frequency of the demand nodes. The criteria for demand nodes are (1) the need for UAVs, (2) illegal border crossing, and (3) the number of the illegal border activities and attacks. There are three vehicles per hub in the second model. The results of two mathematical models for routing problem are evaluated. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This work proposes an approach to cluster and sort a set of alternatives considering multi-criteria categories with a partial order structure. It can be considered a heuristic approach because it does not attempt to derive an optimal partial order among all conceivable clusters of alternatives. Rather than this, it intends to be a simple approach that is transparent to the Decision Maker (DM) whose assistance is sought to help shaping the results. The approach proposed arises from the conjugation of traditional Clustering analysis and Multi-criteria sorting tools. At the outset, the number of categories and their characteristics is unknown. First, we need to detect only the clusters themselves on the basis of a similarity measure independent of the preferences of the DM. Next, we detect potential partial order relations that might exist between them, according to the subjective preferences of the DM. Such preferences are elicited only after the DM has examined the clusters detected and deemed that these categories made sense. The new approach performs very well in a real-world problem of management of intragroup conflicts and conflict handling strategies.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the dynamic and multi-criteria decision-making problems under uncertainty, generally represented by multi-criteria decision trees. Decision-making consists of choosing, at each period, a decision that maximizes the decision-maker outcomes. These outcomes should often be measured against a set of heterogeneous and conflicting criteria. Generating the set of non-dominated solutions is a common approach considered in the literature to solve the multi-criteria decision trees, but it becomes very challenging for large problems. We propose a new approach to solve multi-criteria decision trees without generating the set of all non-dominated solutions, which should reduce the computation time and the cardinality of the solution set. In particular, the proposed approach combines the advantages of decomposition with the application of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods at each decision node. A generalization of the Bellman's principle of decomposition to the multi-criteria context is put forward. A decomposition theorem is therefore proposed. Under the sufficient conditions stated by the theorem, the principle of decomposition will generate the set of best compromise strategies. Seven MCDA methods are then characterized (lexicographic, weighted sum, multi-attribute value theory, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, and PROMETHEE II) against the conditions of the theorem of decomposition and against other properties (neutrality, anonymous, fidelity, dominance, independency), in order to confirm or infirm their applicability with the proposed decomposition principle. Moreover, the relationship between independency and temporal consistence is discussed as well as the effects of incomparableness, rank reversals, and use of thresholds. Two conjectures resulted from this characterization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The first one is based on the Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa's procedure of even swaps, while the second derives from the Roy's ELECTRE-TRI.

abstract={New approach to community heating systems modernization and development planning process has been proposed. It is based on the general decision making aid algorithm. The proposed algorithm takes into account both demand and supply side of community heat market modernization and development. The first step of algorithm - analytical step, refers to data base creation, which is needed for the description of community heating system energy, ecology and economic characteristics. Analysis of those characteristics allows for the identification of heating system market modernization and development potential scenarios. The second algorithm step - decision step, allows for the identification of the most compromise scenarios of system modernization and development. To make the planning process more transparent and to increase the influence of decision makers on the planning process the ELECTRE III method was chosen as the tool of decision aid. The ELECTRE III method is based on the construction of outranking relation and definition of pseudo-criterion. The iteration mode of method application allows the decision maker and analyst for the investigation of the sensitivity of final solution to the changing preference model. One of the methods of statistics - the creditability of mean range method was used for the determination of initial definition of pseudo-criterion. Proposed algorithm and decision aid method were employed for the case study analysis referring to the choice of the heating system for new developing urban area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, a new non-compensatory approach is introduced for the material selection of bipolar plates in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC), using the original ELECTRE I (Elimination Et (and) Choice Translating Reality) decision-making method. This approach provides solutions to material selection problems of bipolar plates involving multiple conflicting objectives, particularly when the compensation among the criteria is not allowed. By producing a material selection decision matrix and a criteria sensitivity analysis, the ELECTRE I can be applied to perform a reasonable material selection for a particular application, including a logical ranking of considered materials. A list of all possible choices from the best to the worst suitable materials is obtained, taking into account all the material selection criteria, including the cost. There is good agreement between the results of the methods being used and available experimental data and the Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) databases. A user-defined code in Mathematica has been developed to facilitate the implementation of the method for material selection problems of fuel cell components. © J. New. Mat. Electrochem. Systems.},

abstract={Increasing growth and development of building industry and civil engineering motivates enterprises to advance bid evaluation process in an effort to ameliorate building quality and diminish construction cost. The selection of qualified construction contractor has been generally formulated and addressed as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem. However, few existing studies have taken the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes into account. Therefore, a two-stage logic scoring of preference-ELECTRE III-based approach is established for the management and manipulation of bidder selection. In a bid to facilitate expert evaluation articulation, alternative-attribute assessments in this approach take the form of generalized comparative linguistic expressions, which are subsequently converted into possibility-distribution-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set via the similarity measure-based generation approach to enhance information quality and reliability. Then, nonlinear optimization-based direction rules are introduced to advance the automatic minimum-distance-based consensus reaching model and based on which, the individual semantic-embedded assessments are algorithmically adjusted to reach acceptable consensus. Furthermore, the expert and attribute importance degrees are extracted from both semantic and formal logic aspects, and the modified individual assessments are gathered by integrating the two-stage logic scoring of preference aggregation structure and the ELECTRE III method. The present approach provides a solution to bid evaluation problems considering the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes. A practical case study and a comparative analysis are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the established multi-attribute group decision-making approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The leather-processing industry (LPI) is constantly polluting the environment in Bangladesh. As a result, stakeholders are continuously pressurizing managers working in LPI to embrace green leather-processing activities. Thus, the green concept is attracting significant attention from managers in the Bangladeshi LPI. However, the industry is struggling with many barriers to implementing green supply chain management (GSCM). There are many studies regarding barriers to GSCM. However, those studies failed to show the possible pathways to implement GSCM. This study addresses the gap by evaluating barriers to GSCM considering effective pathways to GSCM. In this study, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is integrated with Elimination Et Choix Traduisant La Realite (ELECTRE-I) method to identify and prioritize the barriers and to rank the possible pathways to implementing GSCM in the leather industry. To accredit the proposed framework, it is implemented on a leather-processing factory in Bangladesh. A sensitivity analysis is performed to inspect the strength of the outcome of this method. The outcome of this study indicates that the high cost of advanced technology is the most important barrier to implement GSCM while green technology and techniques are the most effective pathways to GSCM. The findings of this research will support researchers and practitioners by giving insights on barriers and possible pathways to implementing GSCM. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The design of a building is a decision problem with multiple stakeholders and several often conflicting criteria. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods are capable of handling decision problems with the abovementioned specific features. This paper focuses on the application and comparison of some of the most well-known and widely applied MCDM methods; namely AHP, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, and PROMETHEE II. For this purpose, a framework that incorporates the decision-makers’ preferences and the use of dynamic simulation of the potential building forms is developed and applied to a real-life case study. This procedure provides a holistic approach through which the design team arrives at a more appropriate decision. The examined methods yield similar results, showing broad agreement on the top ten alternatives, amongst which the decision-makers can decide. In particular, the majority of the examined methods (all except TOPSIS) concluded with the same optimal solution, a situation that provides confidence in the final decision. Furthermore, an investigation of four “what-if” scenarios indicates that TOPSIS is the most sensitive method to the examined changes in the subjective preferences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Efficiency and effectiveness of logistic activities, in general, and of distribution networks, in particular, are largely influenced by the way warehouses operate as nodes of these networks. In recent years, warehouse management has undergone major changes due to the increase of e-commerce and competition in time-reduction. Despite that, logistic costs of warehouse processes (e.g. receiving, storage, order picking and shipping, etc.) are still often high. Referring to the order picking process, related activities may be optimized by a proper assignment of products to storage locations. In the literature, this problem is known as Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP). Due to the multi-criteria nature of SLAP, a combined ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS based approach under an uncertain environment is designed in the present paper. Aiming at properly dealing with the uncertainty of the decision process, an interval extension of both ELECTRE TRI and TOPSIS is proposed. Therefore, ELECTRE TRI is firstly used to assign products to shelf levels whereas TOPSIS is afterwards applied to determine their storage locations within every level rather than using a random assignment policy. The whole methodology has been designed in cooperation with a Sicilian company that provides logistic services all over the Italian territory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Existing assessment tools mainly focus on environmental and economic issues and give limited consideration on social sustainability. This study fills this gap through proposing an integrated building-specific sustainability assessment model. This model was developed based on a conceptual model of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), which is theoretically a combination of environmental life cycle assessment, life cycle cost analysis, and social life cycle assessment. An integrated AHP-ELECTRE approach was adopted to provide a logical backbone for the model. This LCSA model is demonstrated through a case study to choose the best alternative regarding sustainability from three structural designs, that is, modular construction-based, semiprefabricated, and conventional designs. Results show that semiprefabricated design is the best option in the context of this study. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

The elimination and choice expressing reality methods, referred to as ELECTRE, belong to the outranking methods. Despite their relative complexity, avoiding compensation between criteria is one of the main advantages of the ELECTRE methods. However, no version of ELECTRE methods has the capability to deal with both interval data and target-based criteria. Target-based criteria are applicable in many areas ranging from material selection to medical decision-making problems. Efficiency of the modified ELECTRE method (ELECTRE-IDAT) was examined through two challenging examples. Also, a sensitivity analysis was performed to show advantages of the ELECTRE-IDAT approach. Additionally, the concept of bounded criteria was explained and applicability of interval data as well as benefit, cost, and target criteria were described with a biomaterial selection problem. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

One alternative source for the filament is to reuse and recycle post-consumer plastic products, which is also a compelling approach to conserve energy and sustain the environment. Thus, this study is focused on the materials selection of virgin polymer resins and recycled post-consumer plastics for use in 3D printer filaments. A multi-criteria decision method of Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE) was utilized to determine the best materials for 3D printer filaments. The study has shown that the virgin low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are optimal materials as an alternative filament among other options such as virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), virgin PET, virgin polypropylene (PP) and recycled HDPE. Aside from the different options of the type of materials, the various properties considered in the calculation include tensile strength, melting point, glass transition temperature, melt flow index, coefficient of thermal expansion, and cost.

abstract={With the growing awareness of environmental and social issues, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has received considerable attention both in academia and industry. Supplier selection plays an important role in the successful implementation of sustainable supply chain management, because it can influence the performance of SSCM. Sustainable supplier selection is a typical multi-criteria decision-making problem involving subjectivity and vagueness. Although some previous researches of supplier selection use fuzzy approaches to deal with vague information, it has been criticized for requiring much priori information and inflexibility in manipulating vagueness. Moreover, the previous methods often omit the environmental and social evaluation criteria in the supplier selection. To manipulate these problems, a new approach based on the rough set theory and ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) is developed in this paper. The novel approach integrates the strength of rough set theory in handling vagueness without much priori information and the merit of ELECTRE in modeling multi-criteria decision-making problem. Finally, a case study of sustainable supplier selection for solar air-conditioner manufacturer is provided to demonstrate the application and potential of the approach. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a hybrid fuzzy decision making approach, combining elements of fuzzy-ELECTRE and Fuzzy-TOPSIS, towards a new ranking procedure. The main objective of FETOPSIS is to offer rankings with good alternative discriminatory power to decision makers (DMs). This research work was motivated by a real case study in which multiple attribute decision making techniques were used to select the best set of investment projects for the industrial restructuring of a small oil company in Brazil. After the application of Fuzzy-TOPSIS and ELECTRE II, the obtained rankings were quite deceptive from the DMs' point of view, either to very close scores or by the excess of indifferences among alternatives. Our developed approach uses the closeness coefficients to rank the alternatives, following Fuzzy-TOPSIS, however they are computed over the normalized fuzzy concordance and discordance indexes based on the ELECTRE family. Extensive computational experiments were performed to evaluate our method. The good results obtained by FETOPSIS in the experiments, both in terms of alternative discriminatory power of rankings, and eliminating ranking reversal cases, gave us the confidence to apply the method in the real case. The DMs praised the developed approach, since the obtained rankings were more discriminatory in the alternatives than both Fuzzy-TOPSIS and ELECTRE II, making it possible to select with confidence a set of suited alternatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, the authors present their concept of public transportation on demand based on autonomous vehicles. They develop several passengers' transportation solutions based on driverless vehicles and compare them with traditional forms of passenger transportation (tram, bus, taxi and individual car). The authors carry out a multiple criteria evaluation of all eight considered variants. They formulate the decision problem as a multiple criteria ranking problem. Thus, a consistent family of evaluation criteria is constructed. It includes the following measures: travel time, travel costs, comfort of travel, reliability, timeliness, availability, environmental friendliness, safety. Based on the analysis of stakeholders' interests the model of preferences is defined. It is composed of two major elements: importance of criteria and sensitivity of the decision maker (DM) towards changes of the criteria values. A series of computational experiments is performed. In the computational phase a multiple criteria ranking method - Electre III/IV is applied to generate the final ranking of all considered variants - transportation solutions. The position of variants based on autonomous vehicles is thoroughly discussed. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection of an automated inspection device for an explicit industrial application is one of the most challenging problems in the current manufacturing environment. It has become more and more complicated due to increasing complexity, advanced features and facilities that are endlessly being integrated into the devices by different manufacturers. Selection of inspection devices plays a significant role in a manufacturing system for cost effectiveness and improved productivity. This paper focuses on the application of a very popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tool, i.e. ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) for solving an automated inspection device selection problem in a discrete manufacturing environment. Using a sample case study from the published literature, this paper attempts to show how different variants of the ELECTRE method, namely ELECTRE II, IS, III, IV and TRI can be suitably applied in choosing the most efficient alternative that accounts for both the decision maker's intervention and other technical elements. Using different ELECTRE methods, a list of all the possible choices from the best to the worst suitable devices is obtained while taking into account different selection attributes. The ranking performance of these methods is also compared with that of the past researchers. © IJTech 2014.},

The method is applied to 29 EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) countries of operation. The results are visualized in the form of a relation tree, thus providing clear insights for policy-makers regarding how countries stand relative to each other. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Methods based on fuzzy outranking relations constitute one of the main approaches to multiple criteria decision problems. The use of ELECTRE methods require the elicitation of a large number of parameters (weights and different thresholds); but direct eliciting is often a demanding task for the decision-maker (DM). For handling intensity-ofpreference effects on concordance levels, a generalized concordance model was proposed by Roy and Slowinski which is more complex than previous outranking models. In this paper, an evolutionary multi-objective-based indirect elicitation of the complete ELECTRE III model-parameter set is proposed. The evolutionary multi-objective inference method is successfully extended to inferring reinforced-preference model parameters. Wide experimental evidence is provided to support the proposal, which performs well even working on small size reference sets.},

TODIM, on the other hand, is a method that is based on the paradigm of Prospect Theory and that has elements of both the French and the American School of MCDA. Although ranks obtained by both methods were different, the same project was ranked as the best alternative according in both. The practical experience described in this paper has suggested that the use of MCDA methods in the ranking of project can significantly clarify the decision making process.},

First basic concepts and intuitive semantics are introduced. Then we give rules to model dynamic semantics of ELECTRE programs: this constitutes an operational semantics for the ELECTRE language. This operational semantics is used to define a model of execution for ELECTRE programs: transition system. In addition, we prove, using structural induction on the operational semantics, that this transition system is afinite state transition system. Eventually, we extend the previous transition system so as to handle multiple-storage events: it is important since the asynchronous ELECTRE language deals with multiple memorized occurrences of the events. This result gives a means of compiling the ELECTRE language into a finite-state machine. © 1995.},

The composite containing 5 wt% pineapple fiber exhibit the highest coefficient of friction, whereas wear performance and friction stability remain highest for 5 wt% hemp fiber based composites. The recovery performance remains highest for the composite containing 15 wt% banana fiber, while fade, friction variability, and fluctuations remain lowest for 10 wt% banana fiber reinforced composites. The tribological results indicate that the inclusion of disparate natural fibers in varying amounts may differently affect the tribological performances and therefore to choose the best brake friction composite satisfying the maximum beneficial criteria hybrid ELECTRE II- entropy optimization technique is used. Brake friction composite containing ~10 wt% banana fibers was ranked first, in meeting the desired performance tribological properties. A comparison of this optimization approach with other multi-criteria decision-making techniques is also made for validating the performance ranking of these composites. © 2020},

abstract={For the issue of users’ sensibility to the QoS (Quality of Service) of multimedia applications, cloudlet has emerged as a novel paradigm which provides closer computing resources to users to improve the performance of multimedia applications and meet the QoS demands of users. However, the increasing users’ requirements of migrating tasks pose a challenge to preserve the security and integrity of offloaded data which are processed by cloudlets. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based cloudlet management method for multimedia workflow, named MWSM, is proposed in this paper. Technically, we first model each multimedia application as a multimedia workflow and formulate the multimedia workflow scheduling problem. Then, blockchain is adopted to secure the data integrity during the offloading procedure. Besides, NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) is employed to realize the QoS enhancement and ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Tradulsant la REaltite) is utilized to solve the decision-making problems of the most optimal scheduling strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and potential of our proposed scheduling method. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A novel fuzzy-based approach which combines ELECTRE III along with the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) is proposed in the present work to comparatively evaluate the service quality in the public healthcare context. Specifically, ELECTRE III is firstly considered to compare the service performance of examined hospitals in a noncompensatory manner. Afterwards, IPA is employed to support the service quality management to point out improvement needs and their priorities. The proposed approach also incorporates features of the Fuzzy Set Theory so as to address the possible uncertainty, subjectivity and vagueness of involved experts in evaluating the service quality. The model is applied to five major Sicilian public hospitals, and strengths and criticalities of the delivered service are finally highlighted and discussed. Although several approaches combining multi-criteria methods have already been proposed in the literature to evaluate the service performance in the healthcare field, to the best of the authors’ knowledge the present work represents the first attempt at comparing service performance of alternatives in a noncompensatory manner in the investigated context. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: Hospital evaluations create competition between healthcare providers. In this study, a multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is used to evaluate criteria that affect hospital service quality. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Criteria affecting hospital service quality are identified. Four Iranian public hospitals are evaluated using these criteria. Four hybrid methods, including modified digital logic–technique for order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution, analytical hierarchy process–technique for order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution, analytical hierarchy process–elimination and choice expressing reality and modified digital logic–elimination and choice expressing reality are used to evaluate hospital service quality. Results are aggregated using the Copeland method and final ranks are determined. Findings: The four main criteria for evaluating hospital service quality are: environment; responsiveness; equipment and facilities; and professional capability. Results suggest that professional capability is the most important criterion. The Copeland method, used to integrate four MCDM hybrid methods, provides the final hospital ranks. Practical implications: The criteria the authors identified and their weight help hospital managers to achieve comprehensive organizational growth and more efficient resource usage. Moreover, the decision matrix helps managers to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Originality/value: New and comprehensive criteria are proposed for hospital quality assessments. Moreover, a new hybrid MCDM approach is used to achieve final hospital rankings. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The ideal configuration of wastewater treatment system (WTS) for attending cities specificities has become a complex decision, due to the fact that there are several available technologies, and a diversity of characteristics presented in the scenario of each city. Considering the importance of economic analysis, especially in developing countries, this work aims to demonstrate the economic feasibility considering cost-related indicators for the ideal WTS selection for specific features in these cities. Based on a literature review, 37 main WTS and two economic cost-related indicators (Net Present Value and Annualized Net Present Value) were considered. First of all, using a multicriteria analysis these WTS were grouped in classes using the ELECTRE TRI method, based on criteria related to efficiency, and the weights were defined by appointments from research specialists in the literature appointments. The economic analysis was performed using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method, which has been applied specifically to each WTS class, thus generating a framework of economic viability for this context. The WTS with low and high costs were appointed, considering the development level in each applied scenario. This work contributes to expanding the WTS study horizons to select an ideal system, considering the economic aspect. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

We expand stepwise benchmarking algorithm with data pre-processing procedure based on the decision maker's judgments about the performance levels. For this purpose, we devised a new module in stepwise benchmarking model, which translates the sequence of descriptive, non-numerical decision maker's assertions into scoring parameters. The proposed preference elicitation procedure enables to accommodate decision maker's perception on performance of benchmarking units. Thereby distinct performance characteristics are acknowledged and practical feasibility of benchmarking paths is enhanced. The important feature of the proposed procedure is that it allows proceeding with more scoring options, which can occur with some performance indicators. The model is implemented among European Union member states in the field of digital connectivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban water systems (UWSs) are challenged by the sustainability perspective. Certain limitations of the sustainability of centralized UWSs and decentralized household level wastewater treatments can be overcome by managing UWSs at an intermediate scale, referred to as small to medium sized UWSs (SMUWSs). SMUWSs are different from large UWSs, mainly in terms of smaller infrastructure, data limitation, smaller service area, and institutional limitations. Moreover, sustainability assessment systems to evaluate the sustainability of an entire UWS are very limited and confined only to large UWSs. This research addressed the gap and has developed a set of 38 applied sustainability performance indicators (SPIs) by using fuzzy-Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) I outranking method to assess the sustainability of SMUWSs. The developed set of SPIs can be applied to existing and new SMUWSs and also provides a flexibility to include additional SPIs in the future based on the same selection criteria. © 2017, Water Environment Federation.

abstract={Classification problems refer to the assignment of alternatives to predefined categories. In this work we focus on ordered classification, called sorting, in which the predefined categories indicate several degrees of interest or suitability of alternatives for a certain user. The assignment of alternatives is based on multiple conflicting criteria. This multi-criteria sorting approach is specially interesting for recommender systems aimed at finding the most suitable alternatives for each user. First, we study the ELECTRE-TRI-B sorting method, which follows the outranking approach based on comparing the evaluations of alternatives with the profile limits separating the categories. The complexity of some recommenders systems requires the extension of the classical ELECTRE-TRI-B method to manage a taxonomical organization of the set of criteria. In this paper we consider a set of criteria in the form of a hierarchy. The intermediate criteria in such a hierarchy correspond to different aspects of the recommendation procedure, such as content, context or cost. At each of these criteria, a sorting problem must be solved. Therefore, we propose extending ELECTRE-TRI-B to handle assignments of alternatives on several levels of the hierarchy. A hierarchical procedure for sorting is proposed, called ELECTRE-TRI-B-H. Secondly, the paper explains the integration of ELECTRE-TRI-B-H into a recommender system of touristic activities related to wine, called GoEno-Tur. This system is developed for the region of Tarragona, Catalonia (Spain), which is a well-recognized area of wine and cava production. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Almost all of the today's modern daily life conditions of humankind depend on the electricity. The countries either by only themselves or sometimes with some international intuitions and/or organizations have been trying to find the best methods, ways, and projects to supply the electricity to their societies. One of the important tools for the countries to increase the amount and quality of the electricity generation is to activate/ignite/initiate the private investment capabilities/opportunities. The electricity generation market in Turkey is a free/open market for both the foreign and domestic private investors. Hence, both the foreign and domestic private investors have been looking for the most suitable electricity generation plant projects. Small hydropower plant (SHPP) investments (SHPPIs) are one of the alternatives in the Turkish electricity generation market especially for the private investors searching for the renewable energy investments. This experimental research study investigates the possibility of using the ELECTRE III/IV, Shannon's Entropy, and Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) subjective weighting (for criteria) methods for the solution of this problem. In the experimental case study, the most appropriate SHPPIs amongst five alternative SHPPIs at the SHPPIs' predevelopment investment stages in Turkey were evaluated and ranked in order. © 2015 Burak Omer Saracoglu.},

From this point of view, in this study, the site selection of the plants used for planning and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment wastes was realized using the methods of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In this study, to determine the appropriate ranking of alternatives, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), ELECTRE and PROMETHEE that are different MCDM methods were used. In this context, this study is the first and only such research conducted in all of Turkey. For site selection in Turkey for waste recycling plants of WEEE, 7 criteria were used and 16 city alternatives were considered. The ranking of first 5 cities, which are observed with AHP, ANP, ELECTRE and PROMETHEE methods are given. In this point of view, the best alternatives are determined as İstanbul, Ankara and İzmir cities. In these results, "Population" and "EEE plant number" criteria have been effective since these have the largest weight.},

The motivations behind this work are to remedy to some of the methodological problems in composite indices such as the Tourism Climatic Index, where a weighted sum is computed using ordinal data. We present our results for the summer month of August on the basis of the years 1961-1990 derived from the CRU CL 1.0 climate database of New et al. (1999). In addition to being theoretically sound, our approach uses the original, virtually untransformed, continuous data thereby avoiding loss of information. It also minimizes the compensation effects and makes it possible to take into account additional criteria to cater to various tourism contexts with various decision maker profiles. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The design of critical components for aerospace applications involves a number of conflicting functional requirements: reducing fuel consumption, cost, and weight, while enhancing performance, operability and robustness. As several materials systems and concepts remain competitive, a new approach that couples finite element analysis (FEA) and established multicriteria optimization protocols is developed in this paper. To demonstrate the approach, a prototypical materials selection problem for gas turbine combustor liners is chosen. A set of high temperature materials systems consisting of superalloys and thermal barrier coatings is considered as candidates. A thermo-mechanical FEA model of the combustor liner is used to numerically predict the response of each material system candidate. The performance of each case is then characterized by considering the material cost, manufacturability, oxidation resistance, damping behavior, thermomechanical properties, and the FEA postprocessed parameters relating to fatigue and creep. Using the obtained performance values as design criteria, an ELECTRE multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) model is employed to rank and classify the alternatives. The optimization model is enhanced by incorporating the relative importance (weighting factors) of the selection criteria, which is determined by multiple designers via a group decision-making process. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={Introduction: The problem studied in this paper is the road insecurity, which is manifested by the big number of injuries and deaths recorded annually around the world. These victims of road accidents worry the whole community, hence the duty and the need to find solutions for reducing the number of victims and material damage. The overall purpose of this case study is to treat the problem of corporeal accidents known in France. Case description: The case study presented in this paper is intended to help decision-makers to find and understand the all significant relationships and correlations that exist between the conditions that led to these corporeal accidents. In fact, the two French ministries of interior and transport have jointly created a unique database on corporeal accidents, called BAAC “Accident Analysis Bulletin Corporal”, with the aim of allowing different exploitations of this database by different concerned administrations and research organizations. Our intervention consists to adopt a hybrid approach based on data mining techniques combined to the multicriteria decision methods. This approach allows to extract the most relevant association rules. The results thus obtained can be easily exploited by the decision-makers to choose the appropriate policies in the perspective of improving road safety. Discussion and evaluation: The proposed approach ranks all association rules in order of importance for several quality measures of association rules. The alternatives at the top of the ranking are the results to retaining for the analysis. The approach is applied to the BAAC database of 2016, which led to the selection of three association rules. These association rules reveal that there are narrow correlations between the following elements: Driver with Pedestrian, Normal Surface of Road with Normal Atmospheric Condition and the Pavement with Pedestrian. These correlations can be justified by excess speed and carelessness of the drivers. Conclusion: The improvement of the road safety needs mainly to work more intensively on the behavioral side of the road users. For future work, it is planned to apply the proposed approach to the French traffic accident database, containing all the data on road accidents collected over several years. In addition, other measures will be used in the ranking of the association rules. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={We propose a decision-aiding evaluation procedure (i) for classifying road crossings based on their impact on walkability and, subsequently, (ii) for prioritising street improvements, in urban-rural fringe areas. In the peripheral urban-rural fringes, pedestrian mobility is usually less developed and people generally depend more on cars for their everyday chores. Partly this is inevitable given the structural features and supply of services and activities in such areas, but part is due to a frequent neglect of pedestrian mobility in planning and urban design. Measures to improve this state of affairs can include the design of more pedestrian-friendly environments offering to potential users a greater level of security, comfort and convenience when walking to their designated destinations. Our evaluation procedure combines a walkability assessment methodology with the ELECTRE TRI rating procedure, in order to assist planners and decision makers in designing physical streets to enhance the continuity, safety and quality of pedestrian paths. Improving the walking accessibility in the fringe areas of towns is a way to reduce the physical and perceptual distance which separates these contexts from the rest of the city, thus leading to a progressive integration of urban functions. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the managerial efficiency and the customer satisfaction of Parisian boutique hotels by using the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. Design/methodology/approach: In the first stage, hotels’ managerial efficiency is assessed by data envelopment analysis to establish which hotel has the most efficient performance. In the second stage, the customer satisfaction of these hotels is estimated by the ELECTRE (ELimination et Choix Traduisant la RÉalité) method to assess the hotel’s ability to satisfy their customers. Findings: Empirical results show that there is an inverse relation between customer satisfaction and ability to maximise the Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). In other words, trying to improve efficiency implies a reduction in guests’ satisfaction (and vice versa). Research limitations/implications: Therefore, through this research the authors can realise that hotel managers should give more attention to customer service because it has a more direct and important impact on customer satisfaction. It also positively impacts on resource management. However, there are some limitations to this study. First, this study only focuses on 12 hotels. Because the data set is very confidential, it is very difficult to have a bigger sample. Then, the evaluation is based on 2014 figures only. It could be interesting to know their performance for previous years to understand their evolution. Finally, it is necessary to know the percentage of direct reservations for each hotel. For instance, if a hotel is relying too much on online travel agents (i.e. Booking.com, Expedia, etc.), it needs to pay a significant amount of commission to these companies. As a result, it could have a good RevPAR but might pay a huge commission (for example, 20 per cent for most of sites) at the end. In terms of perspectives, it is necessary to conduct a more extensive research to test the hypothesis in a different context. Additionally, the data were taken for a single period of time. It will be very interesting to create a panel of hotels and collect data over a period of time (Barros, 2005; Barros and Santos, 2006; Barros and Deike, 2008). This would enable to better understand the relationship between managerial efficiency and customer satisfaction in a long-term prospective. Originality/value: This paper presents the relationship between the managerial efficiency and customer satisfaction in Parisian boutique hotels context. Study suggests that in service industry, increase of firm’s efficiency could negatively impact the guest satisfaction. Therefore, through studying the authors can realise that why hotel managers should focus on customer satisfaction, which attributes play the vital role in customer satisfaction and how to optimize their resources. One of the originalities of this paper is that the authors use the customers’ feedback from the UGC websites (Trip Advisor and Booking.com) as the performance evaluation indicators for customer satisfaction. The data are very confidential and hard to get. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The focus of this study was to carry out an evaluation of solid waste disposal site selection in the city Aräk of Iran. Based on published information, different methods have been applied to address this problem, among which Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been found to be a fruitful approach. Owing to the imprecision in the objective and subjective factors affecting the problem, for tackling the uncertainty and imprecision in human behavior, in this paper a new fuzzy MCDA approach is applied in an intelligible manner to construct the real decision matrix. Fuzzy Multicriteria Hierarchy Process (FMHP) and ELECTRE methods are the two successive steps employed to cope with imprecision in the assessment of the criteria and alternatives to select the best site. Given a fuzzy judgment matrix, FMHP produces a real decision matrix that is applied as an input for ELECTRE to build outranking relations among the actions. The integration of FMHP and ELECTRE considers both the fuzziness and partiality of the factors affecting site selection problem into account and avoids compensatory offsets between several criteria with weak and strong values. Finally, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method as an instrumented decision support model. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

Little has been discussed about the risk assessment in dams with the use of multicriteria analysis. This research is related to risk assessment in the operation of earth-fill dams with the use of two multicriteria methods. Specifically, the risks of three specific dam projects, in the Prefecture of Trikala (Greece) are examined, using the AHP and ELECTRE I. For each dam, the most likely risk of dam failure is different. The risk due to internal erosion in dams is a common finding of both methods, when examining the risks factors for the three dams as an aggregate. The conclusion resulting from the resolution of both methods is that the first dam is more exposed to risk. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In relation to the economic crisis, the airports were pressed from their national civil aviation authorities and from the market to lower their costs and improve their capability in organizing the supply of public facilities. Some airports reacted to this situation improving their efficiency in invoicing and collecting user charges. An enterprise that supplies different services to the Italian Aviation Authority and to several Italian companies who are airport concessionaires decided to analyse the Italian airport revenues from off-flight services, in order to compare their different results and help them improve their product offerings and identify new products' value drivers. To meet this requirement, an outranking method, ELECTRE Tri, was used to evaluate the marginal and overall activation of each Italian airport in reacting to the crisis and making profit by organizing public facilities and services that are different from the classic air navigation services on the ground. The choice of the method and the adopted procedure were motivated by the difficulties in reliable data acquisition, comparison of different and almost incomparable situations and preference elicitation, without the involvement of the actual decision makers and, in relation to a sequence of model versions, different in terms of problem structuring and parameters definition. A collaborative procedure of model structuring and incremental result analysis and several ELECTRE Tri applications, assigning each airport to a specific category, were oriented to the generation of a 'robust' model and a clear result, to read and synthesize all the information elements, understand the situation and acquire a shared vision of the problem, orient the process of information acquisition and support the definition of some improving actions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Vendor selection is a strategic issue in supply-chain management for any organization to identify the right supplier. Such selection in most cases is based on the analysis of some specific criteria. Most of the researches so far concentrate on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. However, it incurs a huge computational complexity when a large number of suppliers are considered. So, data mining approaches would be required to convert raw data into useful information and knowledge. Hence, a new hybrid model of MCDM and data mining approaches was proposed in this research to address the supplier selection problem. In this paper, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering as a data mining model has been used to cluster suppliers into groups. Then, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) method has been employed to rank the suppliers. The efficiency of this method was revealed by conducting a case study in an automotive industry. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The selection of a Computerised Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is a strategic decision in any industry. In hospitals such systems are becoming increasingly necessary because of the high proportion of the budget allocated to the maintenance area and the increasing demand for quality from both health-care professionals and patients. The aim of this study is to propose a more satisfactory CMMS selection process. The process uses a decision-making model based on the use of the multicriteria technique ELECTRE II in two stages. First, the software suppliers that can guarantee a successful implementation of the CMMS are selected. Then, the CMMS that best meets the organisation's needs and requirements is selected. To demonstrate the process, the authors present a case study of the selection process in a Spanish regional health service. Finally, a discussion of the influence of the public health-care environment on the final decision is offered. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques are particularly suitable for Energy and Environment (E&E) decisions due to multiple criteria nature of these types of problems and they have been widely applied in this area. Main points that can be taken into consideration when examining the MCDA literature related to E&E are the selection of appropriate method, selection of criteria to be used and the widely distributed application areas. The motivation behind this study is designing such a Decision Support System (DSS) that enables the energy decision makers to perform analysis using different methods of MCDA and different criteria from various application areas and test the applicability of the system through an application in Turkish Energy Sector. The system includes several methods of MCDA and common parameters from previous studies in order to provide different approaches of evaluating decision problems. With this feature, the system stands on the intersection of MCDA and E&E fields. Moreover, an application of MCDA in Turkish Energy Sector has been performed to test the applicability of the system and some conclusions about electricity distribution in Turkey are put forth. © 2011 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.},

abstract={The process of coordinating with the European Union forced the Turkish government to set up new obligations and an environmental policy for Turkey. The new regulations are more obligatory and have more district lines than the preceding policies. According to the new regulations, municipalities have to prepare packaging waste management plans. In this manner, choosing a packaging waste management system appears to be an important decision making problem. Hence, economic, social, cultural, and technical factors in choosing packaging waste management systems should be considered together. A system may have several criteria to be evaluated and different alternatives to be chosen. Due to the structure of this type of problem, it is considered as a multicriteria decision making problem. Taking this fact into consideration, within the scope of the present study, which it is hoped will provide alternatives for decision makers, 5 recycling scenarios were presented concerning the composition of municipal solid waste in Eskişehir. Consequently, these scenarios were evaluated according to their benefits, costs, and risk factors, using analytic network process (ANP) and ELECTRE III techniques. The results of both techniques were compared. Scenario 3a [10% curbside collection (commingled recyclables) + 5% recycling containers + 5% material recovery facility] was determined to be the most appropriate recycling system with both techniques. © TÜBİTAK.},

abstract={For decision support systems, the software agents’ integration provides an automated, cost-effective means for making decisions. The agents in the system autonomously plan and pursue their actions and sub-goals to cooperate, coordinate, and negotiate with others, and to respond flexibly and intelligently to dynamic and unpredictable situations. In real time production management, the DSS memorizes the current state of the workshop. It knows constantly all possible decisions and the possible events involved. We distinguish 3 contexts for the decision-making aid: (1) Decision-making aid in the context of an acceptable sequence; (2) Assistance for the admissibility covering; and (3) negotiation support among different decision-making centers in a dynamic context. The present paper proposes an agent architecture-based DSS in order to solve some uncertainty problems in dynamic production system scheduling. The proposed DSS gives the decision centers the opportunity to make decisions in a dynamical context. Specifically, Integrated Station of Production agents will be equipped with a sufficient behavior to carry out practical operations and simultaneously react to the complex problems caused by the dynamic scheduling in real situations. These agents express their preferences by using ELECTRE III method in order to solve differences. The negotiation mechanism is based on the well-known Contract Net Protocol. The approach is tested through simple scenarios. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: The impacts of alternative forest watershed management practices are examined from a multicriterion viewpoint in order to select the most satisfactory management scheme. The selection process is carried out using two types of multicriterion decision making techniques: the outranking types of ELECTRE I and II, and the distance‐based type of compromise programming (CP). The process is illustrated using the U.S. Forest Service Beaver Creek Experimental Watershed in the Salt‐Verde River Basin of Arizona as an example. The desired objectives of the experimental study and the alternative forest watershed resources management schemes are transformed into an evaluation matrix of alternatives versus criteria array. Analyses of the matrix using the aforementioned techniques result in a complete preference ordering of the feasible alternatives in the cases of ELECTRE LI and CP and a partial ordering when ELECTRE I is used. In addition, some sensitivity analyses have been performed and showed ELECTRE II and CP to be fairly robust with respect to parameter changes, while ELECTRE I being highly sensitive to changes in threshold levels. Overall the three techniques pointed out that 65 percent vegetation cut is the best management scheme, while the next best is shown to be 50 percent vegetation cut. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract={Flood is one of the natural disasters that generates a lot of damages every year in different points of the world. Also, soil erosion is among the processes that threats the soil and water resources of the country. The performance of a small watershed is not same as the hydrologic response of a large watershed. Determining the amount of participation and prioritizing the sub-basins in terms of flood generation in the outlet of the basin can be a large help in correct locating the flood control and soil and water conservation projects and leads to decreasing the negative impacts of the flood control operations at unnecessary regions or at the regions with lower priority and also it prevents personal tastes. Therefore, determining the flood generator regions and prioritizing the sub-basins in terms of flooding and sedimentation potential is essential for better management of the watersheds. For this purpose, the aim of this research is to determine the amount of participation of the eastern sub-basins of the Gorganrud River Basin of Golestan province, Iran in flooding and sedimentation and their prioritization in terms of flooding and sedimentation potential using the multi-criteria decision-making methods. In this present study, we used area estimation indices, gravel coefficient, drainage density, basin average slope, basin average height, curve number, cover percentage, sediment yield, sediment delivery ratio, runoff height and concentration time. Indicators are considered to be important indicators affecting water permeability, runoff production and, consequently, the potential for flooding and sedimentation. Following the formation of decision matrix with 13 options (sub-basins) and 11 criteria (evaluation index), Technique For order Preference by Similarity to ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Elimination Et Choice Translation Reality (ELECTRE) and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) techniques were used to prioritize sub-basins. Borda and Copland methods were used to combine the rank of proposed techniques. Also, in order to validate the models, we estimated the percentage change and the intensity of the changes. The results showed that the highest runoff height index (0.179) and the average height index of the basin had the lowest weight (0.031), according to experts. Considering the results of the combined ranking of the proposed techniques, sub-basins 12, 1 and 2 are in first to third priority, respectively, and have a more critical situation than the rest of the sub-basins. Field studies clearly show the results of the research, because sub-basins 12 and 1 exhibit the highest erosion, poor soil and gradient. Also, zones with flood and sedimentation potential in the area showed that 49/31% of the area in high and very high risk. This study proves that multi-criteria decision-making methods and RS and GIS techniques are very suitable, precise, economically and temporally advantageous, and helpful tools to evaluate and prioritize the sub-basins in the soil erosion and soil and water conservation topics. Therefore, considering the multiple objective functions and the costly watershed management operations, it can be said that multi-criteria decision-making methods can be used for better management of watersheds in terms of biological and structural flood control operations. So, prioritization can be done based on a mathematical logic. The proposed method in this research is very suitable for watersheds without sufficient data. Hence, such researches which are low cost as well as quick can be used and watersheds can be prioritized for management and conservative acts. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This work deals with the sorting of the suitability of the roofs for the integration of PV systems, implementable as a GIS (Geographical Information System). Such sorting can provide relevant information to help and guide urban actors further develop solar energy, and therefore contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of this source of energy in cities. Three scenarios of sorting are considered: the energetic, the economic and the multicriteria sorting. The energetic and economic sorting scenarios are actually similar to the great majority of the currently proposed sorting in publicly available solar GIS tools (solar cadastre), which consider only one attribute such as the solar irradiation or the payback period. Knowing the limits of these sorting scenarios, a multicriteria approach is adopted and takes into account more impactful attributes in the urban actors’ choices. The ELECTRE TRI methodology is used for this sorting problem. Different decisional criteria related to energy, economy, historic buildings and heritage, the structure and superstructure states of the roof are identified and detailed. The method is then applied to a set of alternatives (roofs) in a district of Geneva. The sorting results show that the proposed multicriteria scenario better integrates the complexity of the urban environment and provides a more relevant information regarding the suitability of the roofs for PV integration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Inadequate construction and demolition waste disposal create severe environmental impacts in cities when it occurs in an uncontrolled manner. For waste with the possibility of recycling, the appropriate destination would be recycling plants or landfills. In the investigative process, no studies were found that considered the sorting procedure by compensatory and non-compensatory multi-criteria analysis integrated to the Geographic Information System to choose suitable landfills or recycling plants in cities. This study aims to fill this gap with a structured methodology for mapping suitable sites to receive inert waste from small and medium cities. For this, it was considered the identification of relevant criteria and weights definition by Analytic Hierarchy Process method and after performing a sorting procedure by ArcGIS 10.0 software (compensatory aspect) and ELECTRE TRI method (non-compensatory aspect). And then, an aggregate analysis in order to support the decision-making was also developed. An experimental study was carried out with the application of this methodology in a city of the south western of Parana, Brazil, allowing the analysis of criteria such as land use, soil type and slope, as well as distances to urban area, education and health institutions, roads and highways and hydrography network. We combined these data in a multi-criteria analysis to provide an aptitude mapping to identify suitable landfill areas with 5 km2, and sorted as low, medium and high aptitude classes by ArcGIS software and ELECTRE TRI method. With all that, it shows to be efficient, providing relevant practical and theoretical implications to this theme. © 2020},

abstract={Water shortage is one of the most critical problems all around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Using groundwater can be an efficient solution in such lands. Although significant care and appropriate water resource management strategies are required to be implemented. Nowadays, subsurface dams (SSD) are widely used worldwide since they are proved to have advantages over surface dams in some cases. Selection of the suitable site for SSD construction is critical. This selection is made based on advantages and disadvantages of each location. Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) is an efficient method for optimum site selection. In this study, 10 regions were chosen as alternatives for construction of subsurface dams in Isfahan province of Iran. These alternatives were then ranked using ELECTRE I, II and modified ELECTRE III based on geological, hydrological, climatological and socio-economical criteria. Results from different ELECTRE methods are combined by applying the grade average, and Borda and Copeland ranking strategies. Application of an advanced MCDM method reduced uncertainties in subsurface dams (SSD) site selection. Alternative 5 (Hoseinabad) was introduced as the best location for subsurface dam construction. This methodology can be used as a basis for more detailed field investigations. © 2019},

abstract={Decision analysis methods provide opportunities to explore alternatives for drinking water resources in impoverished, rural regions of developing countries.With varying success, southwestern Bangladesh communities currently use multiple drinking water sources, including rainwater harvesting, ponds, pond sand filters, managed aquifer recharge (MAR), and tubewells. This study uses a variety of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to assess the probable success of these drinking water sources based on various technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. Data include an assortment of physical and social sources including focus group interviews, surveys, and water quality measurements. Additionally, the MCDA methods (multiple attribute value theory, analytic hierarchy process, ELECTRE I, and ELECTRE III) are informed by preferences from three stakeholders-locals, nongovernmental organizations, and environmental science academics-to ensure proper weighting of criteria for success. Across all MCDA methods, we find that rainwater harvesting is the most likely to succeed as a reliable drinking water source in the region. Conversely, MAR is the least preferred alternative. Sensitivity analyses suggest a robust ranking order that is relatively insensitive to model parameters, including water source performance score and stakeholder weighting, across all criteria categories. This case study demonstrates how decision modeling and alternative assessment can be the first step to reach sustainable solutions in complex water management problems. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={In a few years, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) have had an impact on several different areas of decision science. However, a number of researches have utilized the Elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) methods to determine the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with hesitant information. The aim of this research article is to develop new multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methods, such as the m-polar hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE-I (mHF ELECTRE-I) method and hesitant m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I (HmF ELECTRE-I) method. Proposed MCGDM techniques based on the hybrid models, m-polar hesitant fuzzy sets (mHFS-sets) and hesitant m-polar fuzzy sets (HmF-sets), which are the natural generalizations of HFSs and m-polar fuzzy sets (mF sets). These models enable us to deal with multipolar information under hesitancy. We use the proposed methods to deal the complex problems in which the membership degree of an element of given set uses the m different numeric and fuzzy values, to rank all the alternatives and to determine the best alternative. We present two practical examples that illustrate the procedure of the proposed methods. We also discuss the differences and comparative analysis of the proposed methods. Finally, we develop an algorithm that implements our decision-making procedures by using computer programming. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Sustainable processes have recently awaked an increasing interest in the process systems engineering literature. In industry, this kind of problems inevitably required a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the environmental impact in addition to the economic performance. Bio-based processes have the potential to enhance the sustainability level of the energy sector. Nevertheless, such processes very often show variable conditions and present an uncertain behavior. The approaches presented for solving multi-objective problems under uncertainty have neglected the potential effects of different quality streams on the overall system. Here, it is presented an alternative approach, based on a State Task Network formulation, capable of optimizing under uncertain conditions, considering multiple selection criteria and accounting for the material quality effect. The resulting set of Pareto solutions are then assessed using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality-IV method, which identify the ones showing better overall performance considering the uncertain parameters space. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In metropolitan area, finding a parking space is a difficult task for drivers especially in rush hours. This causes waste of time and fuel and results in traffic congestion. We propose a smart parking system based on multi-agent approach to provide a real-time decision-aid for drivers by handling their preferences. The system ensures an online space allocation based on real-time information by optimizing drivers’ preferences with respect to operational constraints. The online allocation problem is considered as a multicriteria decision-aid problem for which we present a mathematical formulation: multicriteria parking reservation problem. The solution is an optimal compromise from the set of efficient solutions which is determined by means of a multicriteria ranking method ELECTRE III. An update of resource allocation is performed to avoid reservation conflict and to ensure constraints satisfaction. After the reservation process, the driver is assisted via a guidance module to reach the reserved place through the shortest path. Simulation results show the wide applicability of the approach in real cases. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

However, there are very few studies in the field of food. In this work, the selection of optimum fat content in the model beverage of instant hot chocolate beverage was evaluated based on sensory analyses by performing multi-criteria decision techniques (analytic hierarchy process, simple additive weighting, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and elimination et choixtraduisant la realite—elimination and choice translating reality). The wettability, solubility, bulk density, soluble solids, pH, color values, and rheological and sensory properties of the nine samples were evaluated. According to the results of multi-criteria decision techniques, sample S2 which had a relatively high amount of fat content was the most preferred beverage among the samples. Study showed that the use of different fat contents of milk and cocoa powder positively affected the rheological parameters and preferences of consumers. The findings may be considered to improve dairy and cocoa-based products formulation by the food industry. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The basic principles and algorithms of the two methods are initially presented and subsequently the methods are applied using the same input data and related parameters. The results obtained could provide valuable insights on the similarities and differences of the outcomes obtained by applying the ELECTRE III and the PROMETHEE II methods in a real data set regarding geothermal resource exploitation. Furthermore, it is found that the simultaneous application of both methods could improve the robustness of the decision analysis exercise and enhance the legitimacy of the outcome.},

abstract={Day after day, the importance of a company having an efficient storage location assignment system increases. Moreover, since products have different warehouse costs and customers' requirements are also different, it is important to sort products in order to adopt strategies for inventory management that are appropriate for each product. However, adopting a policy for each product is not applicable in the real world. Therefore, companies usually categorize products into classes and thereafter adopt specific inventory management policies. Given this situation, this paper puts forward the arguments for adopting a multi-criteria method, Electre TRI, to sort products that both considers criteria relating to the characteristics of a product as to its physical location in the warehouse and the criteria that are important for inventory strategies, such as, for example, the profitability of each unit held in storage. © 2013 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

The MCDA techniques that are applied for the development of the models are the UTilités Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) and the ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) TRI. We adopt a 10-fold cross validation approach, a re-sampling technique that allows us to split the datasets in training and validation sub-samples. Thus, at the first stage of the analysis the aim is the development of a model capable of reproducing the classification of the firms considered in the training samples. Once this stage is completed, the model can be used for the classification of new firms not included in the training samples (i.e. validation stage). The results show that both MCDA models achieve quite satisfactory classification accuracies in the validation sample and they outperform both logistic regression and chance predictions. The developed models could provide the basis for a decision tool for various stakeholders such as managers, shareholders, and investment analysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Software development project selection decision is a vital process in technological organizations. These decisions are very important in two ways. First, in technovation organizations, software development project budget necessitates huge investment and this project selection decisions should be thought with the strategic objectives of the firm. Second, multidimensionality of the software development projects' organizational returns is naturally risky in terms of expected outcome. Real options approach helps to calculate this risky side of the selection process. This paper considers the software development project selection process in multi-criteria thinking. Vagueness is another consideration in the evaluation process. The fuzzy ELECTRE takes both fuzzy real option value criteria and nonmonetary criteria into account. In this study integration of fuzzy real options valuation to fuzzy ELECTRE is offered for a selection process among software development projects. © 2012 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={In aircraft concept selection, uncertainties, resulting from economic noise variables such as fuel price, load factor, so on always exist in the decision making process. These uncertainties are often addressed using Taguchi loss functions for robustness analysis. The study presented in this paper is to utilize multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to solve an aircraft concept selection problem for a hypothetical airline when considering the robustness of the decision. Three MCDM methods were used to conduct the concept selection, including ELimination and Choice Expressing REality, simple additive weighting and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution. In this study, robustness is introduced as an additional decision criterion in the aircraft selection process. The impact with and without robustness consideration is compared in order to demonstrate how the proposed method makes trade-offs between nominal performance and address uncertainty in the decision-making process. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of the decision criteria, especially robustness, on the final ranking of alternatives. The implementation of three MCDM methods on the aircraft selection problem also demonstrates the potential application of MCDM methods in the assessment of air transportation systems, while balancing economical, ecological, and technical constraints. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The very early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been deeply investigated in numerous studies in the past years. These studies have demonstrated that the pathology usually arises decades before the clinical diagnosis is effectively made, and so a reliable identification of AD in its earliest stages is one of the major challenges clinicians and researchers face nowadays. In the present study, we introduce a new approach developed upon a specific Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA) classification method to assist in the early AD diagnosis process. The MCDA method is centered on the concept of prototypes, that is, alternatives that serve as class representatives related to a given problem, and has its performance index very dependent upon the choice of values of some control parameters. In such regard, two techniques, one based on ELECTRE IV methodology and the other on a customized genetic algorithm, are employed in order to select the prototypes and calibrate the control parameters automatically. Moreover, a new database has been designed taking as reference both the functional and cognitive recommendations of the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology and a neuropsychological battery of exams made available by the well-known Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD). Various experiments have been performed over this database in a manner as to either fine-tune the components of the MCDA model or to compare its performance level with that exhibited by other state-of-the-art classification algorithms. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={In environmental risk analysis, many explanatory factors, often with highly complex interaction relationships, need to be taken into account. This is the case, for example, in the relation between agricultural practices and the quality of superficial aquatic ecosystems. Suspended solids are responsible for clogging salmonid spawning areas and hence for reductions in their populations. We studied the risks of erosion across two small watersheds in Normandy (France) on the scale of the agricultural plot - the level on which good practices can be applied. Plots were defined according to quantitative as well as qualitative criteria: connectivity to the stream, slope, plant cover, presence of embankments and erosion of the banks in the case of plots beside the river. By combining the ELECTRE III multicriteria analysis method to a geographical information system (GIS), it was possible to discriminate zones that present a risk with respect to particle emission and then to present the results in map form to provide decision-making aid for local actors.

abstract={The organisations that are in pursuit of reconfigurations are often presented with a number of options and, hence, face the problem of evaluating the feasible alternative configurations before choosing the best one. The problem becomes more dominant if the conditions wanting reconfigurations change from time to time. There are a variety of factors which may either support or oppose a particular alternative. Therefore, there is a need for an appropriate methodology to evaluate the different configurations. This paper presents an approach for the assessment of alternative configurations using multiple criteria. This paper considers a manufacturing system which produces 30 products using different conventional machines and process plans for each product. This system is simulated using ProModel 6.2. Subsequently, eight different alternative configurations were developed and simulated, each under 24 experiments. The simulated results that pertain to 216 experiments were subjected to analyses to establish the competitiveness of the alternative configurations. For this, the Elimination and Choice-Translating Algorithm (ELECTRE) was used. The details of the simulation models, the analysis of the results, the ELECTRE approach and the drawn inference are presented in the paper. Copyrigth © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.},

abstract={Purpose – To propose a multicriteria approach for ranking the performance of the economic sectors of the Portuguese economy and to identify the most attractive sectors. Design/methodology/approach – A multicriteria approach using ELECTRE III and SRF software for eliciting the weights of criteria is used to solve the ranking problem statement. Findings – The sector nonmetallic mineral products was ranked in first place in relation to all the rankings; the wholesale trade and retailing trade sectors were ranked in second place in relation to all the rankings; the sector wood, cork and furniture was ranked often in second place; the electronic and electrical industry sectors was ranked in third place; the agriculture and fishing sector was ranked in the tailend of the ranking; the agroindustry sector and the transportation and distribution sector consistently were ranked in the lowest positions, just before the agriculture and fishing sector. Research limitations/implications – Other evaluation criteria can be used to improve the relative ranking classification, namely strategic and operational performance measures. Practical implications – The results of this application are useful for investors, business leaders, and policy makers. From the perspective of potential investors, investment opportunities can be evaluated based on the attractiveness of the economic sectors studied. From the perspective of Portuguese policy makers and business leaders, sectors of the Portuguese economy that are in need of fundamental restructuring are easily identified. For these sectors, business strategies and policy initiatives that are based on benchmarking effective innovations are in order. Therefore, joint partnership between business leaders, policy makers and higher education to lay the ground for innovative practices in these sectors may prove very useful. Originality/value – The proposed multicriteria approach utilized in this study is simple; furthermore it has the capacity to deal well with uncertainty. This study also contributes to an important, yet relatively new body of applicationbased literature, dealing with a multicriteria approach to decision making with the aid of fuzzy theory methodologies. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Drugs were evaluated by an expert panel via the open Delphi approach, where the written score was discussed on 16 items, covering medical, health, legal, and criminalistic issues of the drugs. After this face-to-face discussion the drugs were scored again. Taking the assessment of ketamine as an example, it appeared that each expert used its own scale to score, and that policymakers do not score deviant from experts trained in the medical-biological field. Of the five drugs evaluated by the panel, p-methoxy-metamphetamine (PMMA), γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and 4-methylthio-amphetamine (MTA) were assessed as more adverse than ketamine and psilocine and psilocybine-containing mushrooms. Whereas some experts slightly adjusted during the assessment procedure their opinion on ketamine and PMMA, the opinion on mushrooms was not affected by the discussion held between the two scoring rounds. All experts rank the five drugs in a similar way on the adverse effect scale i.e., concordance scale of the Electre model, indicating unanimity in the expert panel with respect to the risk classification of these abused drugs. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This paper introduces the application of the multicriteria method PROMETHEE II to the selection of a portfolio manager. Such application involves four main steps: (1) defining the list of potential actions or solutions to the problem; (2) defining the list of relevant criteria; (3) evaluating the performance of each action based on each criterion; and (4) aggregating these performances with the multicriteria method PROMETHEE II. The use of a multicriteria approach to this problem is appropriate, as multiple criteria seem to be used by decision-makers in the selection of a portfolio manager. Criteria applied to this model are derived from a set of depth interviews with managers of the 12 major pension funds in the Province of Québec. We ended up with nine criteria that turned out to be heterogeneous and conflicting in their nature. These criteria were then grouped into four groups: (1) past performance, (2) investment philosophy, (3) staff criteria, and (4) organizational criteria. The richness of data collected through the interviews allowed us to specify accurately the decision-makers' preference functions. It was thus possible to choose an outranking technique as a multicriteria aggregating procedure. The choice was limited to one technique of the ELECTRE family and one of the PROMETHEE family of methods. The PROMETHEE II was thus used because the interviews revealed that no veto thresholds were applicable to the model. Furthermore, the application is a ranking problem where it is necessary to prioritize a set portfolio managers of from "best" to "worst". Finally, the analysis is concluded by an application of the paper to the selection of a small capitalization stock portfolio manager.},

abstract={For multi-attribute decision making with cardinal numbers and additive aggregation the methods "additive aggregation" and "outranking" for crisp and fuzzy numbers are connected with the concept of linguistic variables. Preference ranking, a generalization of outranking and preference ranking organization methods such as ELECTRE and PROMETHEE, can be divided into three phases, where each of them is defined completely by linguistic variables. The derived method "preference ranking with additive weighting and individual fuzziness" has an improved selectivity or discrimination compared to conventional methods. Moreover the method fulfils four important requirements: preference only for sufficiently large weights, considering evaluation differences outside of thresholds and regarding aggregational and substitutional properties. The simplified method "preference ranking with additive weighting and general fuzziness" allows a reduction of computational resources. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={A multiple-criteria method for ranking actions with uncertain evaluations is presented. The uncertain evaluations are modelled by fuzzy numbers. To compare fuzzy evaluations, four different measures using possibility and necessity concepts are applied. Their aggregation is based on fuzzy connectives with a controlled compensatory behaviour. The desirable degree of compensation is controlled by the decision maker who can move between two extremes: no compensation and full compensation. The aggregation leads to a new definition of concordance and discordance indices. In order to rank actions, a valued outranking relation is constructed via concordance-discordance tests and then exploited using the usual distillation procedure of ELECTRE III. A final partial preorder results from the exploitation procedure. An illustrative example shows the application of the method to a ground water management system. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={In the modelization of frameworks for multi-attribute decision-making, hesitancy embodies a convenient attitude toward undetermined or vague knowledge provided by distinct experts from a group. Hesitant fuzzy N-soft sets are a functional improvement in hesitant fuzzy sets with the practical spirit of N-soft sets. This analytical model accommodates the hesitant situations with evaluations by grades (e.g., in terms of star ratings) and partial degrees of membership. In this article, we approach the problem of selecting alternatives that are described by this model. We advocate for the use of an adapted form of the ELECTRE-II method, that we describe under the name “hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-II method.” With the aim of designing this novel method, we first characterize the notion of hesitant fuzzy N-soft concordance and discordance sets and then construct strong and weak outranking relation, which allow us to rank the objects of the reference set. A practical example concerning the ranking of hotels based on star ratings is fully developed in order to illustrate the applicability of this method. Furthermore, an exhaustive comparison with the hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-I and bipolar fuzzy ELECTRE-I methods is performed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are increasingly used to aid decision-making for sustainable development. However, although uncertainty is present in all decision environments, dealing with incomplete and vague information in decision analysis remains a challenge. Our objective is to simplify the incorporation of uncertainty in the scoring of alternatives in MCDA processes. We present a modified ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) III model, in which the uncertainty in the performance scores is expressed as lower/upper bounds and then added to the model's discrimination thresholds. Unlike other uncertainty approaches developed in the literature (such as those based on fuzzy set theory), our approach does not require additional knowledge apart from understanding the ELECTRE III model. To test its validity and suitability, we apply it for the evaluation of renewable energy resources for Turkey – hydro, wind, geothermal, solar, and biomass – under five main criteria: technological, technical, economic, environmental, and socio-politic. Our results indicate that wind energy is the best alternative for Turkey, followed by solar energy, which is in line with country's Vision 2023 energy targets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Achieving a good urban form has been a problem since the formation of the earliest cities. The tendency of human populations toward living in urban environments and urbanization has made the quality of life more prominent. This article aimed to calculate the quality of life in an objective way. For this purpose, the technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), vlseKriterijumsk optimizacija kompromisno resenje (VIKOR), simple additive weighted (SAW), and elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) have been utilized. Quality of life was assessed at three spatial levels. In this regard, socioeconomic, environmental, and accessibility dimensions were considered. As a result, in the first level of comparison, sub-districts in District 6 were ranked higher than that of District 13. On the second level, for District 6, vicinity sub-districts had higher rankings than the center, and for District 13, sub-districts near the center of the city had higher rankings. In the third level, District 6 had a higher quality of life. The results of the comparison between research methods showed that the SAW method performs better in terms of stability. Based on the results of correlation tables, there was a strong and direct relationship between each pair of methods at three spatial levels. In addition, as the study area became smaller, the similarity between the methods increased. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The emergence of modern complex systems is often exacerbated by a proliferation of information and complication of technologies. Because current complex systems challenges can limit an organization's ability to efficiently handle socio-technical systems, it is essential to provide methods and techniques that count on individuals' systems skills. When selecting future employees, companies must constantly refresh their recruitment methods in order to find capable candidates with the required level of systemic skills who are better fit for their organization's requirements and objectives. The purpose of this study is to use systems thinking skills as a supplemental selection tool when recruiting prospective employees. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that studied the use of systems thinking skills for recruiting purposes. The proposed framework offers an established tool to HRM professionals for assessing and screening of prospective employees of an organization based on their level of systems thinking skills while controlling uncertainties of complex decision-making environment with the fuzzy linguistic approach. This framework works as an expert system to find the most appropriate candidate for the organization to enhance the human capital for the organization. Several large industries, among others, Boeing, the government such as the Army, Military Academy, and National Science Foundation, highlighted the significance of having qualified (systemic) individuals who can successfully deal with complex systems problems. The correct recruiting decision will reduce the rate of job turnover and also help organizations to eliminate unnecessary budget allocated for costly recruitment processes. The proposed framework is intended to first evaluate the pool of applicants according to their level of systems thinking skills and then rank them based on the recruitment strategy and workforce needs of the organization. To achieve the purpose of the study, two recruiting strategies are adopted from the human resource management literature 1) Job-Fit Recruiting strategy—finding candidates who are most aligned with a specific position requirement and 2) Flexible Recruiting strategy—finding candidates with the highest potentials. The proposed framework is validated using a real case study in a US large-scale organization. © 2020},

The aim of this paper is to screen appropriate green chain suppliers based on a framework using fuzzy TOPSIS and ELECTRE for a Chinese internet company. The framework is proposed, grounded on a literature review on green supply chain management practices, after which an empirical analysis is made to be applied an integrated suppliers selection, based on green practices incorporating specifically data collected of the 12 criteria from a set of 12 available suppliers. We use a fuzzy TOPSIS and ELECTRE approach to rank the green chain suppliers, and the results of the proposed framework are compared with the ranks obtained by both the outranking degrees and the incomparability among the actions of fuzzy ELECTRE methodology. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the feasibility of the best alternative. The results indicated that the best supplier was alternative 9, and there were four dominant criteria: management support for GSCM, used environmentally friendly materials, followed legal environmental requirements and policies, and reduced the use of harmful substances. © 2020 by the authors.

The vibrational relaxation time with high temperature corrections, dissociation reaction rates, equilibrium constants for the reverse reactions, the vibrational energy loss ratio due to chemical reaction, and the collision integrals for nonequilibrium transport properties are proposed to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O2. The proposed set of thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters for O2 successfully reproduces existing shock-tube experimental data and the flight and ground experimental data of the ELECTRE vehicle, orbital reentry experiments (OREX) flight modules, and double-cone geometry in the LENS-XX facility. In post-shock and hypersonic flow calculations, it is found that the vibrational relaxation and coupled chemical reactions calculated using the present parameters occur more slowly than using the previous parameters. The delayed nonequilibrium chemical reactions contribute to the extension of the shock stand-off distance, and drastically change the reverse reaction near the wall of the hypersonic vehicle. © 2019},

abstract={An m-polar fuzzy set is a powerful mathematical model to analyze multipolar, multiattribute, and multi-index data. The m-polar fuzzy sets have appeared as a useful tool to portray uncertainty in multiattribute decision making. The purpose of this article is to analyze the aggregation operators under the m-polar fuzzy environment with the help of Dombi norm operations. In this article, we develop some averaging and geometric aggregation operators using Dombi t-norm and t-conorm to handle uncertainty in m-polar fuzzy (mF, henceforth) information, which are mF Dombi weighted averaging (mFDWA) operator, mF Dombi ordered weighted averaging (mFDOWA) operator, mF Dombi hybrid averaging (mFDHA) operator, mF Dombi weighted geometric (mFDWG) operator, mF Dombi weighted ordered geometric operator, and mF Dombi hybrid geometric (mFDHG) operator. We investigate properties, namely, idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness, for the proposed operators. Moreover, we give an algorithm to solve multicriteria decision-making issues which involve mF information with mFDWA and mFDWG operators. To prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed model, we solve two numerical examples with our proposed models and give comparison with mF-ELECTRE-I approach (Akram et al. 2019) and mF Hamacher aggregation operators (Waseem et al. 2019). Finally, we check the effectiveness of the developed operators by a validity test. © 2020 Muhammad Akram et al.},

abstract={Smart PSS (product-service system) has been transcending the scope of traditional PSS through ICTs (information and communication technologies). The co-implementation is a specific way of co-creation to generate value for customer and supplier in smart PSS. Meanwhile, the service failures in co-implementation can bring about service paradox. As such, three key research questions, including the construction of co-implementation of smart PSS, the extension of risk factors in FMECA and the category of identified failure modes, are put forward and conquered by a proposed methodological framework. First, in order to construct the co-implementation of smart PSS involving customer and supplier, the PCN (process-chain-network) diagram with direct interaction, surrogate interaction and independent handling is employed to reflect the nature of interaction. Second, since that the highly complexity of co-implementation of smart PSS can lead to more huge risk, an extended-FMECA (failure mode effect and criticality analysis) sheet is formulated by considering the adaptation of autonomy. Third, to handle the uncertainty of expert judgments more reasonably and determine the weights of risk factors without additional information, a hybrid approach integrating rough-entropy-ELECTRE TRI is proposed to classify failure modes into ordinal classes, so that decision-makers can swiftly access them. This proposed methodological framework also is illustrated by the co-implementation of smart fridge-service system, in which the feasibility and superiority are verified by analysing comparative results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology for identifying the most critical road sections in urban networks in terms of road safety. This approach is useful for the managers of the road network when they need to allocate limited financial resources to several critical sections. Since the resources are not always sufficient to solve all road safety issues, they require a methodology that is able to rank the critical sections. Road safety depends on the interaction of several factors so this methodology has to be based on a multicriteria approach. In earlier articles, the authors of this paper first adopted Electre III and later Concordance Analysis as multicriteria methods for ranking critical points in an urban road network. Both methods have some critical elements, associated with threshold choice (Electre III) and ranking procedure (Concordance Analysis). In order to improve the methodology, the authors have selected two further multicriteria methods (Vikor and Topsis), for comparison with the Concordance Analysis and for evaluating which performed best. In order to identify critical sections in a road network, a suitable set of indicators is defined, taking into account geometric and traffic volume criteria. The multicriteria methods are applied to a real case for ranking, from the worst safety conditions to the best, the most critical road intersections within the urban road network, on the basis of eight criteria. The results of all three methods considered are compared and a sensitivity analysis is performed to test the stability of the results. The results show that the Topsis method performs best in determining a complete ranking of the critical road sections, overcoming some negative aspects associated with the other methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the rapid development of modern medicine, therapeutic schedules of brain-metastasized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are expanding. To assist a patient who suffers from brain-metastasized NSCLC to select the most suitable therapeutic schedule, firstly, we establish an indicator system for evaluating the therapeutic schedules; then, we propose a probabilistic linguistic ELECTRE II method to handle the corresponding evaluation problem for the following reasons: (1) probabilistic linguistic information is effective to depict the uncertainty of the therapeutic process and the fuzziness of an expert’s cognition; (2) the ELECTRE II method can deal with evaluation indicators that do not meet a fully compensatory relationship. Simulation tests on the parameters in the proposed method are provided to discuss their impacts on the final rankings. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to help a patient with brain-metastasized NSCLC at the Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Institute to choose the optimal therapeutic schedule, and we present some sensitive analyses and comparative analyses to demonstrate the stability and applicability of the proposed method. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have various practical applications. Decision-makers face MCDM problems with conflicting criteria daily. Hence, MCDM methods have been developed to enable decision-makers to enhance decision quality. MCDM methods use various calculation approaches to evaluate the rank of alternatives. However, little evidence supports the consistency between the alternative chosen by the MCDM method and the decision-maker's intuitive ideal alternative. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an operational validation scheme to examine and compare the effectiveness of MCDM methods. In the validation scheme, control variables include the number of alternatives, number of criteria, data set distributions, and nondominated data set options (Pareto efficient frontier or complete data set). We also add three weight distributions, namely uniform weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank sum weights, to determine the effect of weights on the MCDM methods We test linear, quadratic, Chebycheff, and prospect utility functions. In addition to the compensatory, noncompensatory, and partially compensatory utility functions, we use the prospect theory utility function. Mean absolute rank deviation and Kendall's statistical rank test, are applied to examine the effectiveness of the methods To show the viability, this study illustrates the proposed scheme by an evaluation process of numerical comparisons among common MCDM methods including technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), elimination et choix traduisant la realité (ELECTRE), the piecewise linear prospect (PLP) theory method, and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Moreover, method-oriented parameter settings such as normalization methods, distance functions, VIKOR's v, and ELECTRE's thresholds are examined. Through the aforementioned settings, we compare the MCDM methods’ ranks with the decision-maker's ranks by using assumed preference utility functions. The results reveal that interactive MCDM methods such as PLP and AHP outperform the others in terms of rank consistency. However, the performance of the MCDM methods is affected by the percentage of existing efficient solutions. More investigations into the applicability of the utility functions in various situations are suggested. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The paper presents the evaluation and selection of the most desired finished goods transportation corridor of delivery for the company which operates in the household appliances industry. To decrease the production costs, the company relocated manufacturing process to China. That is the reason why it is necessary to find a transportation and logistics solution how to supply finished goods from China to the warehouses in central Poland (Lodz) on the most preferable conditions for the company and its customers. The top management of this international company (acting as a Decision Maker DM) is responsible for finding the most suitable supply chain of manufactured goods. To solve the problem the author of this paper implements the Multi-Criteria Decision Making/Aiding methodology. The decision problem is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem. Thus, the author designs alternative global transportation corridors between China and Central Europe (Poland) based on a multimodal transportation process. On this basis she defines different alternatives of delivering goods and evaluates them by a consistent family of criteria. The author models the DM’s preferences and carries out a series of computational experiments with the application of selected MCDM/A ranking methods, especially Electre III/IV and AHP methods. As a result it generates the final rankings of transportation options and gives the DM the most accurate transportation solution. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Requirement prioritization is a process that allows selection of the 'key' candidate requirements, the ones that are the most important for the construction of quality and cost-controlled software. Requirement prioritization brings certain issues and challenges related with the different stakeholders involved in the project, as well as with the prioritization techniques used, which differ in procedures, criteria and metrics. This manuscript compares two multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), AHP and ELECTRE I, seeking to justify which one is the most feasible in the requirement prioritization process of a real-world case study. To accomplish this aim, several criteria were used to compare the applicability and performance of both MCDMs. In order to reflect reality as close as possible, several stakeholders, including software professionals directly related to the case study, were involved. The results confirm the intuition that ELECTRE I is more easily applicable than AHP. ELECTRE I is subject to fewer mistakes in comparisons of the requirements than the AHP method, as these are carried out differently. In fact, due to its inherent complexity, AHP becomes even impractical in software projects with a large number of requirements. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to apply a multicriteria method to define windows for an office building conceived for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under a compromise between landscape view, daylight level on work plan and energy efficiency. The intent is to select one from six proposed window solutions differing in window size, type of glass and solar shading devices. Several methods are applied to assess the performances for each of these criteria. Simulations are performed to obtain the annual indoor daylight levels. The measurement of the sight angles is carried out to quantify the landscape view. The prescriptive method from the Brazilian building thermal regulation is applied to assess the energy efficiency of each solution. The obtained results of the monocriterion analysis indicate several criteria conflict. In order to identify the compromise solution, the ELECTRE III method is adopted by means of the CELECTRE software. The results of the multicriteria analysis indicate that all solutions with solar shading have a more satisfactory overall performance than those with solar control glazing and without shading devices. Due to the large dimensions of the studied floor, large size windows with solar shading devices achieve better overall compromise results. It is concluded that the multicriteria approach is a very effective method to consistently analyze the solutions proposed for a problem and to assist designers to minimize the conflicts between criteria. It allows performing an integrated approach, enabling a more conscious, accurate and responsible decision making. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Trees are vital for improving urban climate in many aspects and dimensions, especially for densely populated environments characterized by high levels of air pollution. This paper presents a decision-making scheme for benchmarking and prioritizing tree species in urban environments. Public authorities in real-life cases put forward trees species based mainly on cost or aesthetics criteria. In contrast to most-real life cases, the proposed approach facilitates the inclusion of multiple criteria to support decision-making i.e. life span, required growth space, planting capability in built environment, aesthetics, tolerance, pollution attenuation, adaptation to local climate, crown density, cost, and potential allergenicity of species. The framework combines two multi-criteria methods to provide an optimal ranking and enhance the robustness of decision-support. The approach is implemented for the center of Thessaloniki, Greece. Mulberry, sweetgum, scholar tree and hackberry are highly ranked and can be considered as excellent alternatives considering their combined performances to all criteria. A thorough sensitivity analysis by varying parameter values demonstrates the robustness of the corresponding ranking. Although there are gaps of knowledge and uncertainties, especially in the quantification of air pollution attenuation, the proposed approach provides a roadmap for decision-makers to put forward tree species in an organized manner. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We introduce the concept of a representative set of parameters for multiple criteria outranking methods: ELECTRE GKMS and PROMETHEE GKS which apply the principle of robust ordinal regression. We exploit the necessary and the possible results provided by these methods to choose a single instance of the preference model, which would represent all other compatible instances. The representative set of parameters is selected within an interactive preference-driven procedure which allows combining some pre-defined targets into different scenarios. Each target concerns enhancement of the results of robust ordinal regression. Precisely, the DM may emphasize either the advantage of some alternatives over the others, acknowledged by all compatible outranking models, or ambiguity in the comparison for some other pairs of alternatives. Selecting the representative set of parameters, we satisfy the desire of some DMs of assigning precise values to variables of the model. We also enable exploitation of the outranking relation for these parameters in order to arrive at a representative recommendation in a traditional way. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Contractor selection is carried out in order to choose a competent and capable contractor to do the work. To help in this selection, baselines are established to ensure that the contractors have the required skills, resources, and abilities to execute the project. Contractor selection is a multiple criteria decision making wherein several criteria are required to be evaluated simultaneously. This paper proposes a decisionmaking model for contractor selection utilizing ELECTRE III modeling. The steps of ELECTRE III model include; estimation of concordance indices, estimation of discordance indices, estimation of credibility scores, performing distillation procedure, and performing complete ranking. To assess alternatives via ELECTRE III, three associated thresholds are defined which are indifference (q), preference (p), and veto (v). These thresholds produce outranking relations with an allowance for data uncertainly. The complete procedure of ELECTRE III modeling is described in the paper. The proposed model is generic and can be used as a tool to evaluate alternatives in several applications such as value engineering, optimum organization structure, and constructability analysis. It enables its users to define the criteria that are deemed important for evaluation. The proposed multiple criteria decision making is novel to construction can be utilized as a successful tool in contractor selection problem. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed methodology. Copyright 2010 ASCE.},

abstract={In the early days of Systems Analysis the focus was on providing tools for optimisation, modelling and simulation for use by experts. Now there is a recognition of the need to develop and disseminate tools to assist in making decisions, negotiating compromises and communicating preferences that can easily be used by stakeholders without the need for specialist training. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires public participation and thus provides a strong incentive for progress in this direction. This paper places the new paradigm in the context of the classical one and discusses some of the new approaches which can be used in the implementation of the WFD. These include multi-criteria decision support methods suitable for environmental problems, adaptive management, cognitive mapping, social learning and cooperative design and group decision-making. Concordance methods (such as ELECTRE) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are identified as multi-criteria methods that can be readily integrated into Decision Support Systems (DSS) that deal with complex environmental issues with very many criteria, some of which are qualitative. The expanding use of the new paradigm provides an opportunity to observe and learn from the interaction of stakeholders with the new technology and to assess its effectiveness.},

In the article it was put forward a proposition of settling the division of variability of value of a relative importance of criteria for the case when a group of people (one stakeholder's representatives) is involved in constituting the so-called a small sample (n < 30). In the first place the homogeneity of the given information applying statistical-descriptive and positional measures was analysed. Then it was proposed to accept the confidence intervals (with the supposed value of the first kind of error) as a basis for determining the variability scope of the relative importance of individual criteria. The differences in the variability ol the individual criteria were determined according to the average arithmetical value calculated in the analysed test among those giving information. The application of the interval estimation constitutes the basis for carrying out of the sensitivity analysis of the final result obtained by the accepted MCDA method. In the analysed decision problem the Electre III method was used.},

abstract={Network convergence across different access technologies holds a promise of enabling ubiquitous service availability but faces several technical challenges. With anticipated proliferation of multimode IP devices, the optimal selection of a service delivery network among multiple IP based wireless access alternatives is one of the important issues that is actively studied and discussed in several standardization forums. Use of Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) algorithms has been proposed in the past for network selection decisions in a heterogeneous wireless network environment. A direct comparison of these algorithms is difficult as this would require the use of another MADM algorithm. A better approach instead is to ascertain the appropriateness of the algorithm to the problem space. This paper provides the basis for evaluating the appropriateness of MADM algorithms for network selection. It analyzes the use of MADM algorithms such as TOPSIS, ELECTRE and GRA for network selection and argues that GRA provides the best approach in scenarios where the utilities of some of the attributes are non-monotonic. The paper proposes a novel stepwise approach for GRA that uses multiple reference networks and explains its working with network selection scenarios. ©2007 IEEE.},

A deck of cards-based method is then used to determine the weights of each criterion, according to the experts’ preferences. Finally, risk categories chosen by the experts are characterised in terms of multiple reference scenarios, also provided by the experts, and the ELECTRE Tri-nC method is used to assign validation scenarios to the risk categories. The results are compared with the experts’ assessments of the collision risk for the same scenarios and also with the individual assessments made by three experts that have not participated in the development of the decision model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems with great uncertainty, making full use of participants' evaluation information could help improve the accuracy and reliability of decision results. Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is an effective tool to represent qualitative data and can fully express the hesitation and preference of decision makers. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an MCGDM method based on PLTSs. In the proposed method, the projection of PLTSs is explored to measure the distance and angle differences between two objects, and Bayesian best–worst method (Bayesian BWM) is used to determine the aggregated final weights of criteria. Besides, the elimination and choice translating reality III (ELECTRE III) method combined with distillation algorithm deals with the projection of PLTSs to obtain the alternatives' ranking of each decision maker. Then, the weighted convex median voting rule is developed to integrate the rankings results regarding all decision makers, which can solve the conflict of ranking results among experts and ensure that the comprehensive ranking results are reasonable and practical. Finally, a case study of health-care waste management is designed and comparative analyses are implemented to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={This study proposes a new method for optimal allocation of Treated Wastewater (TW), in which different stakeholders, their social position in decision-making, and priority of objectives were attended using the leader-follower game theory. The suggested methodology was applied in a case study in the eastern part of Tehran province in Iran, where the Water and Sewage Department is considered the leader and four TW dependent districts are the followers in the game model. The leader appropriates a certain TW quantity to the system, and the followers compete for the allocated resources in the face of various physical and sociopolitical constraints. The Nash-Harsanyi production function was applied to model the non-cooperative relationships among the followers (i.e., their competition for limited resources) and find a compromise solution. Considering different limitations, such as the location and quantity of the TW allocation, 1569 different allocation scenarios were considered in four districts. Then, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based multi-objective optimization model was developed to optimize the main objectives of the leader, including i) minimizing the TW transfer costs, and ii) minimizing the supplied demand deficiency in all districts. A multi-criteria decision-making model was utilized to find the best solution on the achieved Pareto-front space. Nine different weighting scenarios were adopted to assess the model sensitivity to the importance of the selected criteria. Results point to the sensitivity of the framework to weighting scenarios, but provide effective compromise solutions to a complex system that can only partially supply water demands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study proposes an optimization framework based on a hybrid information-entropy approach to identify leakage events in water distribution networks (WDN). Optimization-based methods are widely employed in the literature for such purposes; however, they are constrained by time-consuming procedures. Hence, researchers eliminate parts of the decision space to curtail the computational burden. Here, we propose an information theory-based approach, using Value of Information (VOI) and Transinformation Entropy (TE) methods, in conjunction with an optimization model to explore the entire decision space. VOI allows for the entire feasible space search through intelligent sampling, which in turn ensures robust solutions. TE minimizes redundant information and helps maximize the spatial distribution of sensors. The herein proposed model is developed within a multi-objective optimization framework that renders a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. ELimination and Choice Expressing the REality (ELECTRE) multi-criteria decision-making model is then used to select the best compromise solution given several weighting scenarios. The results of this study show that the information-entropy based scheme can improve the precision of leak detection by enhancing the decision space, and can reduce the computational burden. © 2019},

abstract={Most of the existing studies investigate the robot selection problem (RSP) in a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) manner, from the viewpoint of a single person. This contradicts the reality that the robot selection decision is usually made by a committee or a group of experts with different expertise and concerns. For this reason, this paper proposes a group decision making (GDM) methodology for handling multiple criteria robot selection problem (MCRSP), the working process of which is (i) identifying experts, (ii) implementing the standard MCDM process and (iii) achieving a group consensus. Four objective weight determination methods, namely, Shannon entropy, CRITIC, ideal point and distance-based, are proposed to represent four experts. Experts play the role of think tank in supporting the decision maker who is responsible for MCRSP. In light of that the preference among different experts is uncertain, stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis is then applied to achieve a holistic evaluation results for identifying good compromise choices. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our methodology, and compare the results with those obtained through VIKOR and ELECTRE II. © 2019},

abstract={The globalization of the olive oil market has caused greater competitiveness in terms of olive oil quality and production costs and the main countries interested in olive growing, have introduced efficient planting design and horticultural techniques in order to meet these requirements. In this paper the sustainability of olive orchard planting management for different olive fruit-harvesting methods has been assessed on the basis of the data gathered by the Geographic Information System and processed using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making Analysis. In particular, three different agronomic scenarios have been analyzed and a specific cultivar has been considered in order to ensure the comparability of the results obtained. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis to assess the optimal harvesting methods for different agronomic scenarios by varying the olive grove dimension has been conducted. The final aim of this paper is to propose a new approach to discover the best harvesting technique on the basis of the type and the dimension of the olive grove. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Due to the increasing awareness of environmental and social issues, many practitioners and researchers have paid attention to sustainable supply chain management. As the performance of suppliers determines the success of supply chains, sustainable supplier selection becomes more and more important. Existing sustainable supplier selection models evaluated the sustainability of suppliers in three aspects (economic, environmental and social) and assumed that values on different criteria can completely compensate for each other directly. However, in reality, criteria in economic, environmental and social aspects are heterogeneous, and the decision-maker’s preferences on criteria belonging to different aspects are different. In this case, values on criteria belonging to different aspects are not allowed to completely compensate for each other directly. To solve this problem, this paper aims to propose a hybrid sustainable supplier selection approach integrating compensatory and non-compensatory decision rules. Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed approach, the compensatory decision method Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to evaluate performances of suppliers with respect to economic, environmental and social aspects. The non-compensatory decision method Elimination and Choice Translating Reality is used to evaluate performances of suppliers on sustainable criteria comprehensively. Through the proposed approach, only criteria belonging to the same aspects are allowed to compensate for each other directly. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed integrated approach is effective and efficient to help the decision-maker select optimal sustainable suppliers. Findings: This is an original approach that integrates compensatory and non-compensatory decision rules, which can benefit from the two kinds of decision rules simultaneously. The integrated approach can be used as an aid for companies to select the best sustainable suppliers. Originality/value: This paper presents an original integrated sustainable supplier selection approach using both compensatory and non-compensatory methods. It can benefit from the advantages of both compensatory and non-compensatory methods. The proposed approach can express preferences of the decision-maker on sustainable criteria sufficiently and maximize economic benefits while meeting environmental needs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The model is applied to a database, retained from AIDA, involving a sample of Italian innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. The main finding is twofold. From a theoretical point of view, the credit rating model proposed allows to incorporate an override in the credit class, as required by Basel II in all the cases in which the availability of data is insufficient to describe the risk factors or a judgmental rating model is advised, as well as in innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. From an operational point of view, this methodology could be a useful tool for banks’ innovative lending processes, because of the lack of a credit model in this context. © 2017, © 2017 Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Currently, large quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many cities of the developing countries are being dumped in informal or formal but unregulated dumpsites that threaten the ecological environment and general public health. The situation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania is of particular concern and is further challenged by a rapidly growing population and urbanization without adequate waste management systems. Current MSW treatment options have been selected based on the judgment and the experience of individuals with authority while underestimating the role of scientifically derived techniques. This study analyzes the most efficient waste treatment options, particularly scenarios with the lowest economic and environmental costs (EcC and EnC, respectively). It uses 12 years (2006–2017) of MSW management data and compares potential waste treatment options for the identified waste streams. A total of 108 different scenarios were designed, and a multi-criteria analysis method was applied to enable the identification of 11 scenarios with acceptable EcCs and EnCs. These formed an initial decision matrix of aggregation dominance that was then categorized into four groups, each represented by the most ideal point. Finally, the dominant scenario that formed the core for all considered options was found. It costs around $274,100 USD while saving about 1585 metric tons (MT) of CO2 emissions daily. This suggests that after all the MSW generated in the city is collected and segregated, organic waste should be composted whilst plastic, paper, glass, and ferrous metal should be recycled. After treatment, other waste will go to some form of landfill. Sustainable management of MSW in this city and others with similar conditions should consider particular local conditions and could use the methods and the findings of this study as a starting point. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Indirect approaches for eliciting preference model parameters for multiple criteria decision aiding are of growing interest because they imply relatively less cognitive effort from the decision-maker (DM). Direct approaches are particularly hard in the case of the new ELECTRE TRI-nB method, because the task involves eliciting a number of limiting profiles for each category boundary. However, in ELECTRE methods, the simultaneous inference of the whole set of parameters needs the construction and resolution of a non-linear non-convex programming problem, which is typically very hard to solve. Therefore, an evolutionary-based method to infer the parameters of the ELECTRE TRI-nB model is proposed in this paper. The quality of the solutions is tested by measuring the capacity to restore the assignment examples and the capacity to make consistent assignments of new actions. In extensive computer experiments, using the pseudo-conjunctive assignment procedure, some main conclusions arise: (i) the capacity of the method to restore the training examples reaches high values, mainly with three and five limiting profiles per category; and (ii) the capacity to make appropriate assignments of new actions (not belonging to the training information) can be greatly improved by increasing the number of limiting profiles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Irrigated agriculture has considerable impacts on the environment. To minimize negative effects and maximize positive effects, it is necessary to provide comprehensive analyses beyond the strictly technical domain. In this study, we apply a methodology for determining priorities in implementing irrigation plans using multi-criteria analysis methods on a specific case study area in the sub-catchment area of the Orljava River in Požega-Slavonia County, Croatia. Five potential irrigation areas (Orljava-Londža, Pleternica, Ovčare, Treštanovci, and Venje-Hrnjevac) were analyzed according to five selected criteria: environmental protection, water-related (four sub-criteria), social, economic, and time criteria with different criteria importance (weight). The aim of this study was to confirm the adequacy of using six multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methods (mostly used: PROMETHEE, AHP, ELECTRE TRI, and the less used: DEXi, PRIME, and PCA) in determining priorities for fulfilling irrigation plans, present models for preparation of the input data, apply certain methods, and compare the results on the selected case study area. The methods' adequacy was confirmed during the research. Five of the six MCA methods identified the Ovčare area as the most appropriate for irrigation development (i.e., it has priority in implementing the irrigation plan). According to one (AHP) of the six methods, Orljava-Londža has more advantages over other areas. All MCA methods, except PCA, chose Venje-Hrnjevac as the least advisable (last to be implemented) alternative. Conclusions from this research confirm findings from recently published research regarding the application of MCA on water management problems. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In the era of the Sustainable Development Goals, for which one of the aims is to provide universal access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, it is crucial to target and prioritize those who remain unserved. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models can play an important role in WASH planning by supporting priority-setting and policy-making. However, in order to avoid misleading assumptions and policy decisions, data uncertainty — intrinsic to the available collection methods — must be integrated into the decision analysis process. In this paper, we present two approaches to incorporating data uncertainty into MCDA models (MAUT and ELECTRE-III). We use WASH planning in rural Kenya as a case study to illustrate and compare the two approaches. The comparison focuses on the way these two models handle uncertainty in the available data. The analysis shows that, while both methods incorporate data uncertainty in a considerably different manner, they lead to similar prioritization settings. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Sidewalks constitute the main guideway for the walking mode of transport and serve as a fundamental infrastructure for personal travel including commuting. This is because practically every motorized trip is preceded or concluded by nonmotorized travel. The assessment of sidewalk performance, in the sense of its suitability for walking, involves consideration of multiple aspects, whose precise treatment requires in turn the use of multicriteria methods to support decisions. This article proposes a multicriteria methodology for this purpose, thus setting the stage for a subsequent agency decision regarding maintenance strategy development. The methodology is based on a set of infrastructure attributes, directly intervenable by these authorities, and uses the ELECTRE TRI method to assign sidewalks under study to performance classes. It is practical to use and can be applied to any city, at any scale. The approach is thoroughly discussed, and demonstrated for a case study comprising several sidewalks in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. The results indicate that a considerable fraction of these sidewalks are in mediocre condition, and the multicriteria classifying methodology readily suggested intervention strategies, effectively aiding in the decision making. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Different types of cloud service providers such as direct sellers, resellers and aggregators provide services with different level of service features and quality. The selection of best suitable services involves multi-criteria nature of services to be compared with the presence of both qualitative and quantitative factors, which make it considerably more complex. To overcome this complexity, a fuzzy hybrid multi-criteria decision making approach has been proposed, which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. Triangular fuzzy numbers are used in all pairwise comparison matrices in the Fuzzy ANP and the criteria weights are utilized by Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy ELECTRE methods to rank the alternatives. This strategy is demonstrated with selection of cloud based collaboration tool for designers. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to prove the robustness of the proposed approach. © 2016, IGI Global.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to put forward a methodological framework to provide a comparative assessment of available mitigation and adaptation strategies against climate change. Mitigation options aim at minimizing CO2 and other green house gas emissions, in an effort to reduce the rate of increase in global temperature. On the other hand, adaptation options relate to the ability of the natural or human systems to handle the impact of the climate change and to adjust to its effects, seeking to eliminate the adverse consequences and take advantage of any beneficial outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology focuses on specific parameters, leading to the most efficient package of alternatives for the area of Greece. The selection of the “optimal” ranking of alternatives in a defined strategy is a sophisticated procedure, and a multi-criteria decision-making process was established. A questionnaire was designed and used as input to the overall framework, based on specific decision criteria. Climate change experts gave their feedback via a face-to-face interview. ELECTREIII multi-criteria decision analysis was adopted forth e comparative evaluation, as it fits best to complex environmental problems. An “optimal” sequence of mitigation and adaptation strategies was provided for Greece. Findings - The use of renewable energy sources, increase of energy efficiency and improved forest management - tree planting and rational water management - are among the most promising options to strategically plan climate change mitigation and adaptation for Greece. Originality/value - The presented study provides an insight into alternative mitigation and adaptation strategies against climate change. The use of the multi-criteria analysis is an innovative approach to outline the optimal bundle of strategies. The methodology focuses on specific parameters, leading to the most efficient package of measures for the area of Greece. Such an approach is implemented for the first time in Greece, at least up to the authors’ knowledge, and provides a basis for strategic governance and policy modeling for the area under consideration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Abstract: The water pipe is an important component of the tap water facility, and plays a role as critical as that of the blood vessel in the body. However, accurate diagnosis of its condition is very difficult because it is buried under the ground, even as pipe aging frequently leads to phenomena that threaten water quality such as pipe damage and water leakage. In order to maintain and improve the performance of the existing pipe network, planned examination, operation, and maintenance, as well as technologies for proper renewal, are required. Accordingly, the present research proposes a method that can be used for the maintenance of the pipe network in each water distribution block (WDB). For this purpose, the weighted performance indicator (PI) determined by means of PI and the analytic hierarchy process technique which allows evaluation for individual water WDBs, was applied to the ELECTRE technique which is a multi-factor decision-making method. This result may be used as a reference for water leakage maintenance and for the renewal and change of a WDB. The frequency of pipe accidents is expected to be reduced by appropriate plans set up beforehand. The research was conducted by investigating the 60 WDBs of both Sujeong-Gu and Joongwon-Gu in Seongnam City. The water pipe rehabilitation ranking of the 60 WDBs could be determined as a result. In order to determine the best R model out of the 16R models, a comparison was made of the correlation coefficient, rate of ranking conformance, mean square error, and mean absolute error. The result showed that the R12 model was the most suitable model, while the priority in the maintenance of the pipe network for each block could be determined. As a result, the blocks least suitable for first maintenance were determined to be Blocks 22, 48, 38, 18, and 32, whereas the most satisfactory ones were Blocks 42, 55, 23, 12, and 41. © 2014, © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

abstract={Decision-making processes in water resources projects are often multi-criteria, and numerous techniques have been developed for evaluating these projects. The main concern in utilizing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques is that different techniques may result different outputs, therefore, selecting an appropriate technique is crucially important. Most decision makers prefer simple and transparent decision-making approaches which simultaneously show the trade-offs among the different decisions. This study utilizes multiple comparisons of MCDM techniques to interpret the similarities and dissimilarities of those methods and their consequences in the same project, which is multi-criteria management of stochastic floods in the Sunland Park area (Diez Lagos) in southern New Mexico. The objectives of the Diez Lagos flood control system are flood damage reduction (FDR), increasing usable water supply (WS) from stochastic floods, E. coli remediation (ER) from storm water, riparian habitat restoration (RHR), and human health and safety (HHS) in the study area. For all techniques, we simulated the same decision in the form of a decision matrix with m alternatives (flood control rules) against n criteria (FDR, WS, ER, RHR, HHS, and related Costs). We investigate six techniques: TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), VIKOR (in Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), SAW (Simple Additive Weights), AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), ELECTRE (Elimination et Choice Translating Reality), and Compromise Programming (CP). The evaluation of the numerical results from this study can lead to the selection of the best decision-making technique, which can be extended to other projects. © 2015 ASCE.},

abstract={Ground deformation phenomena affecting the town of Tuzla (Bosnia Herzegovina), as consequence of underground salt deposits exploitation, have been surveyed since 60 years ago. The growing of cavities beneath the town and successive surface deformations have induced several hazard factors such as ground subsidence, deep and shallow fracturing and intense groundwater table oscillations. Fortunately, this processes had no catastrophic consequences such as sinkholes developing. Previous studies analyzed the historical database of topographic and piezometric data and highlighted a cumulative subsidence rate up to 12 meters over a period spanning from the 1956 to the 2003. Fractures arose as obvious result of ground deformation and caused damages and demolitions to thousands of buildings, with almost 15,000 people evacuated. Nowadays, in order to diminish the deformation processes, a strong reduction in brine withdrawal has been introduced by the local authorities. This caused an uplift of the water table which actually makes the spatial pattern of deformation more complex. In fact, in the most urbanized area, the sinking phenomena are now turning into uplift displacements. The presence of such a hazard required an urban vulnerability assessment able to support local authorities in the forthcoming planning procedure. The vulnerability assessment of urban elements over a wide area, potentially affected by deformation phenomena, has been accomplished by an integration between GIS solutions and a multicriteria approach based on ELECTRE-TRI methodology. The vulnerability procedure is able to define a discrete map where the 50 × 50 m width elementary cells report the most vulnerable parts of the town. In particular, the ELECTRE-TRI methodology is used to combine each vulnerable urban element with the others, expressed as vector data in a geographical dataset. The multicriteria approach is performed outside the GIS environment by the ELECTRE-TRI 2.0 package and requires a preliminary rasterization of the used dataset. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This sorting is designed to support maintenance decisions in terms of the measure more appropriate to be applied per region. To illustrate the proposed model, an application was performed in a city with 100 thousand water connections. With this model it becomes possible to improve the allocation of maintenance measures for regions and mainly to improve the operation of the distribution network. © 2012 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

abstract={A fundamental challenge in managing a pharmaceutical company is identifying the optimal allocation of finite resources across the infinite constellation of available investment opportunities. In that context, the optimal management of the new product pipeline has emerged at the forefront of all strategic planning initiatives of a company. The combined use of discrete-event simulation and multi-objective optimization methods to minimize both the failure risk of the product, development time while maximizing profits (Net Present Value - NPV) was identified as an efficient framework in our previous works. In that context, multiobjective Genetic Algorithms are particularly attractive for treating this kind of problem, due to their ability to directly lead to the so-called Pareto front, from which a single solution has to be chosen by the decision maker. To help this final decisional process, this work proposes to resort to multicriteria decision making methods such as ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS and also a new and simple method called FUCA to select the best alternative. The three criteria considered are NPV, risk and makespan for a New Product Development (NPD) problem in the pharmaceutical industry. The four methods are compared on a test-bench example from the dedicated literature, and the conclusion that one would be expect is that no method overcomes the others in any situation. TOPSIS is an all-purpose method giving sometimes worst results, while ELECTRE and PROMETHEE are more efficient when the decision maker preferences are crisply defined. For the proposed example, the FUCA procedure shows a good efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In sustained forest management, it is particularly useful to test the adequacy of various silvicultural scenarios, but decision-making is also becoming increasingly complex because forest managers have to simultaneously meet several different objectives in response to society demands. In order to help forest managers make appropriate choices in silvicultural systems, we propose a SDSS (Silvicultural Decision Support System) that applies to pure and even-aged larch stands (Larix sp.) in lowland areas where site conditions are similar to those encountered in Southern Belgium. Its main purpose is (i) to predict the influence of silvicultural treatments on stand evolution and (ii) assist forest managers in comparing different scenarios with respect to predefined goals. This SDSS consists in three modules designed to elaborate silvicultural scenarios involving (i) stand growth prediction and thinning simulation; (ii) assessment of indicators selected to define the scenarios referring to wood production, financial, technico-economic and ecological components, tree stability and wood quality; and (iii) comparison of the scenarios on the basis of the set of previously assessed indicators (multi-criteria analysis). User-friendly "MGC_Larch" software helps managers to formulate, evaluate and compare different silvicultural scenarios for larch. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.},

Mappac may therefore be considered a 'mixed' or 'intermediate' method, a sort of compromise between the approaches mentioned above. It will also be shown that the aggregated index of mappac is a function not only of the weight of the criteria and of the entity of the difference in evaluation, but also, all other conditions remaining unvaried, of the number of criteria according to which one action is preferred or indifferent with respect to another. It is possible to note a number of similarities and differences between the indices of this method and the concordance indices of the electre methods. © 1991.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel method for the development of an optimal water supply plan showcased using data from the Gamasiab basin, located in Kermanshah province, Iran, concerning new dams that are being constructed in this semi-arid region. In this paper, a new group multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) plan is proposed by combining two MCDM methods based on the fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy ELECTRE III methods that convert the experts' opinions to triangular fuzzy numbers based on the level of uncertainty associated with various quantitative and qualitative criteria. Considering the opinions of four non-stakeholder experts and data analysis using the fuzzy Delphi method, the criteria were evaluated. Then, by analysing the results using the fuzzy ELECTRE III method, the final ranking of scenarios is obtained. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the decision-making system in scenarios ranking. The total expense, flood control, reservoir capacity and diversion and water transfer played a significant role in selecting the optimal scenario. Additionally, a hydrologic model was developed to evaluate the performance of the optimal scenario in terms of qualitative criteria. The data indicated that there was a good agreement between the results obtained from the hydrological model and the scenario ranking by the employed method. Altogether, a comparison of the proposed method with other MCDM methods, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by simulation of ideal solution, indicated that the results of the employed method matched more closely to the local experts' opinion. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Moving towards a global bioeconomy can mitigate climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels. Within this context, this work applies a set of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools to prioritise the selection of five alternative bioenergy systems for residential heating based on the combination of three commercial technologies (pellet, wood stove and traditional fireplace) and two different feedstocks (eucalypt and maritime pine species). Several combinations of MCDA methods and weighting approaches were compared to assess how much results can differ. Eight indicators were used for a sustainability assessment of the alternatives while four MCDA methods were applied for the prioritisation: Weighted Sum Method (WSM), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE). Regarding the sustainability performance indicators, the highest environmental impacts were calculated for the fireplace alternatives, and there was not a best environmental option. Also, no clear trend was found for the economic and social dimensions. The application of MCDA tools shows that wood stove alternatives have the best sustainability performance, in particular wood stove with combustion of maritime pine logs (highest scores in the ranking). Regarding the worst alternative, fireplaces with combustion of eucalypt logs ranked last in all MCDA rankings. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the weighting of the performance indicators confirmed wood stoves with combustion of maritime pine logs as the leading alternative and the key role of the analysts within this type of MCDA studies. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In the 2010 Toronto summit, the leaders of the G-20 countries agreed on the implementation of urgent fiscal consolidation plans, following the expansionary policies adopted to curb the recessionary effects of the financial crisis. Unprecedented cuts in public expenditures have taken place, particularly in the European Union periphery, reviving the discussion on the optimal size of the public sector. Supporters of fiscal restraint defend that bigger governments tend to be more inefficient, its opponents assume that government size determines the effectiveness of its performance. However, the social and economic impacts from contractionary fiscal policies ultimately depend on the level of public sector efficiency. Relatively inefficient governments have more scope to consolidate without compromising social welfare. In this paper, we adopt a multiple decision aiding approach, not previously employed for the assessment of complex macroeconomic performances, and employ the ELECTRE TRI-C outranking method to categorize OECD countries on a set of criteria representing the quality of their public sectors. We then compare the obtained classifications with the share of each government's expenditures on GDP, to identify distinct levels of efficiency. Our analysis suggests that various countries exhibit a margin for efficiency gains, attenuating the social and economic effects of fiscal consolidation policies. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={With the establishment of the Belt and Road national strategy, Quanzhou Port is a significant development opportunity. Quanzhou Port is the origin of the 21st century Maritime Silk Road and part of the Belt and Road, but as a pioneer project of the Maritime Silk Road and the main port in the Belt and Road strategy, its development has encountered some challenges and problems. Hence, this paper aims to evaluate the competitiveness of Quanzhou Port based on the criteria selected by experts and corresponding improvement suggestions are put forward for its weaknesses. Using fuzzy-AHP and ELECTRE III, port competitiveness is evaluated according to the total weights obtained based on the different criteria used. The key criteria consist of six factors (port size, port location, hinterland economy, port costs, operations management and growth potential) that are divided into 18 sub-criteria. Five competing ports were selected with respect to geographical proximity. The order of ranking according to ELECTRE III are as follows: Kaohsiung Port, Xiamen Port, Fuzhou Port, Taichug Port and Quanzhou Port. The findings show that the port of Quanzhou appears last in the ordering sequence, resulting in a need for integrative approaches to promote its competitiveness. Compared with competitive ports, Quanzhou Port has relatively weak overall infrastructure and relatively high port costs, which leads to a lack of obvious flow of port materials and a decrease in professional unloading services. Particularly in hinterland port economies, the industrial structure is extensive and backward. Hence, the question of how to achieve a green transformation of the manufacturing industry will be important for Quanzhou Port. This paper points out directions for the future development of Quanzhou Port and applies comprehensive evaluation methods, namely fuzzy-AHP and ELECTRE III. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={An innovative combined evaluation approach is proposed in the present paper to deal with the issue of the performance measurement and comparison of Urban Waste Management (UWM) services in the context of cities. The ELECTRE III method is initially considered as tool able to execute a multi-criteria analysis aimed at ranking UWM systems based on their integration and sustainability levels. The latter are comprehensively evaluated via the recently developed “Wasteaware” Integrated and Sustainability Waste Management indicators framework, which takes into account physical components and governance aspects of UWM systems. Then, on the basis on ELECTRE III results, a practical gaps investigation is developed to comparatively highlight service weaknesses to be addressed to pursue more equity concerning integration and sustainability in the considered context. The issue is particularly relevant in light of the multi-dimensional nature and the substantial complexity of UWM systems, as well as for the high criticality level assumed by these systems in recent years. The proposed combined evaluation approach is applied to an empirical case which regards the UWM systems of the Optimal Territorial Ambit of Palermo (Sicily). In the considered context, results highlight how stakeholders' participation in decision-making activities represents a crucial factor to pursue shared and coordinated strategies in line with integration and sustainability principles. Moreover, seventeen measures involving operational, environmental, socio-economic as well as administrative waste management aspects are selected from a comprehensive list of measures aimed at waste management integration and sustainability, and then implemented in the investigated context. Through these measures, the resulting services criticalities can be evaluated and properly addressed, and new required processes can be designed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There is increasing legislative and public pressure for the design and build of road infrastructure schemes to achieve better sustainability performance. Roadside noise barriers (RNBs) form a major part of the growing road infrastructure system in mitigating undesirable road noise to impacted communities. However, the relative sustainability of common RNBs is little understood in the research and industry literature. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions with regards to the sustainable design and procurement of RNBs. This paper presents nowel research carried out to assess and rank the relative sustainability of 13 RNB types using three multi criteria analysis (MCA) techniques, i.e. Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Preference Ranking Organisation MeTHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE III). The paper concludes that the presented sustainability rankings of the main RNB types from least sustainable to most sustainable will support the relevant stakeholders, involved in the planning, design, and procurement stages, to evaluate the sustainability of RNB options as either part of a large highways scheme or standalone project. The presented results will save significant analysis time and costs in cases whereby it is unfeasible to conduct MCAs. The presented sustainability asssessment methodology may also provide the basis for an industry sustainability certification sceheme and in turn support advancing the sustainability transport agenda. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vehicle transport is a dominant type of technological processes in rock mines, and its profit ability is strictly dependent on overall cost of its exploitation, especially on diesel oil consumption. Thus, a rational design of transportation system based on haul trucks should result from thorough analysis of technical and economic issues, including both cost of purchase and its further exploitation, having a crucial impact on the cost of minerals extraction. Moreover, off-highway trucks should be selected with respect to all specific exploitation conditions and even the user's preferences and experience. In this paper a development of universal family of evaluation criteria as well as application of evaluation method for haul truck selection process for a specific exploitation conditions in surface mining have been carried out. The methodology presented in the paper is based on the principles of multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) using one of the ranking method, i.e. ELECTRE III. The applied methodology has been allowed for ranking of alternative solution (variants), on the considered set of haul trucks. The result of the research is a universal methodology, and it consequently may be applied in other surface mines with similar exploitation parametres. © Archives of Mining Sciences 2016.},

abstract={The main objective of this study was to choose appropriate locations for two air quality monitoring stations in an urban area in Turkey by using specific decision-making techniques. For this purpose, five different potential locations for an urban station and seven different potential locations for a rural station were evaluated according to two Multi Criteria Decision Making techniques (MCDM): Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité III (ELECTRE III). The main inputs of these methods were the air quality levels and associated pollution hot spots estimated by an air quality dispersion model (AERMOD), and the rankings determined according to the views of experts and local authorities regarding the selection criteria. The prioritization and ranking of the alternatives were determined and compared for both methods. The results of the two methods validated each other since the same locations were determined as the best alternatives by both methods. In this study, AHP and ELECTRE III, which are two well-known MCDM techniques, were used for the first time for the selection of the optimal air quality monitoring stations using seven criteria (pollution levels, security, availability of electricity, collaborations, staff support, easy access, distance). © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to prioritize Indian energy sector projects, namely, coal, gas, hydro and solar using fuzzy PROMETHHE (F-PROMETHEE) and Visual PROMETHEE applications and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analyses. Design/methodology/approach – The MCDM outranking approach of PROMETHEE under fuzzy environment is used. Four projects of energy sector are selected as alternatives and are compared based on various criteria. These criteria selected on the perspectives of life cycle costing (LCC) analysis and related management approaches for prioritizing projects for effective decision-making (DM). The F-PROMETHEE is described and results are also compared with outranking application in Visual PROMETHEE software based on same set of criteria. For better understanding, the graphical representations of the multicriteria problem are also shown using graphical analysis for interactive aid. Findings – On applying F-PROMETHEE on four energy projects, coal and solar projects outrank high and results shows that coal-based project is preferable and should be considered. Research limitations/implications – Here F-PROMETHEE and Visual PROMETHEE are used as MCDM techniques. However, few other MCDM techniques such as ELECTRE and EATWOS can be also explored to outrank Indian energy sector projects. Practical implications – Indian energy sector involves high degree of complexity for effective DM on the front of prioritized investment-related capacity addition through energy projects. Outranking methods like F-PROMETHEE is able to address the criteria to criteria impact on DM support precisely. Social implications – The finding can provide information to the government or public sector regarding various possible investment options on energy projects in India. Originality/value – This paper can be supplement and act as the support for DM in conflicting situations specifically for prioritizing investments on various energy projects, which further can synergize conflicting ideas of various stakeholders of the Indian energy sector. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Human Development Index (HDI) is an indicator that measures individuals’ welfare through three dimensions: health, education and income. Since its conception, the HDI has been a focus of attention for various segments of society such as politicians, professionals in the media, policy makers, academics and ordinary citizens. The index, however, has received several criticisms over the years, the compensatory effect between the dimensions being the main one. In this context, this paper puts forward an alternative approach for calculating the Municipal Human Development Index, thereby mitigating some criticisms of the index and supporting public decision making. For this purpose, the ELECTRE TRI-C multicriteria method was used, in order to attenuate the compensatory effect, to reduce calculation problems and to allow comparison year by year. An application was conducted in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. As a result, a more adequate classification of the regions in four levels of human development was obtained. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) seeks to recommend sustainable dam construction sites based on their environmental and ecological impacts in a long-term plan for dam construction (LPDC) in South Korea. However, if specific information is missing, the SEA is less useful for choosing a dam construction site. In this study, we applied AHP, ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE II and Compromise Programming as MCDM techniques, and used binomial and uniform distributions to generate missing information. We considered five dam site selection situations and compared the results as they depended on both MCDM techniques and information generation methods. The binomial generation method showed the most obvious priorities. All MCDM techniques showed similar priorities in the dam site selection results except for ELECTREE III. The results demonstrate that selecting an appropriate MCDM technique is more important than the data generation method. However, using binomial distribution to generate missing information is more effective in providing a robust priority than uniform distribution, which is a commonly used technique. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper develops an approach for sorting based on randomising the trichotomic decision about classifying an alternative as superior, inferior or indifferent to a certain number of profiles. The alternatives to be classified and the representative profiles are determined by performances under multiple criteria. The alternative is allocated to the category for which the probabilities of being above and below such a category are nearest to one another. A previous development in this stream is ELECTRE TRI-nC. Results of application of the new approach are compared to those obtained in a previous application of ELECTRE TRI-nC. A second analysis explores the new method when applied to a situation in which the evaluations come from a group of people instead of only one evaluator. The robustness of the approach was also tested by comparing classifications from benevolent and exacting rules. The results of application of the different rules are similar.

abstract={At each stage of the product development process, the designers are facing an important task which consists of decision making. Two cases are observed: The problem of concept selection in conceptual design phases and, the problem of pre-dimensioning once concept choices are made. Making decisions in conceptual design phases on a sound basis is one of the most difficult challenges in engineering design, especially when innovative concepts are introduced. On the one hand, designers deal with imprecise data about design alternatives. On the other hand, design objectives and requirements are usually not clear in these phases. The greatest opportunities to reduce product life cycle costs usually occur during the first conceptual design phases. The need for reliable multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods is thus greatest at early conceptual design phases. Various MCDA methods are proposed in the literature. The main criticism of these methods is that they usually yield different results for the same problem [22,23,25]. In this work, an analysis of six MCDA methods (weighed sum, weighted product, Kim & Lin, compromise programming, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE I) was conducted. Our analysis was performed via an industrial case of solar collector structure development. The objective is to define the most appropriate MCDA methods in term of three criteria: (i) the consistency of the results, (ii) the ease of understanding and, (iii) the adaptation of the decision type. The results show that TOPSIS is the most consistent MCDA method in our case. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Many conventional approaches to the assessment of quality of life measure the distribution, density and distances of different opportunities in space. But distance is not all there is. To reason in terms of urban capabilities of people we should also take into account the quality of pedestrian accessibility and of urban opportunities offered by the city.

In most of past literature, expert considered portfolio problem only based on past data. It is very important for experts to use their experience and knowledge to predict the performance of each stock. In this paper, 2-tuple linguistic variables are used to express the opinions of experts to predict the performance of each stock with respect to each criterion. According to experts' linguistic evaluations, we use maximizing deviation method to derive the weight of each criterion. And then, the linguistic ELECTRE method is used to derive the credibility matrix and calculate the net credibility degree of each stock. Based on the outranking index and selection threshold, we can easily obtain portfolio set and decide the investment ratio of each stock. An example is implemented to demonstrate the practicability of proposed method. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Outranking methods propose an original way to build a preference relation between alternatives evaluated on several attributes that has a definite ordinal flavor. Indeed, most of them appeal the concordance/non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is "superior" to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is "sufficiently important" (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that "strongly rejects" it (non-discordance condition). Such a way of comparing alternatives is rather natural. However, it is well known that it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable property of transitivity or completeness. This explains why the axiomatic foundations of outranking methods have not been much investigated, which is often seen as one of their important weaknesses. This paper uses conjoint measurement techniques to obtain an axiomatic characterization of preference relations that can be obtained on the basis of the concordance/non-discordance principle. It emphasizes their main distinctive feature, i.e. their very crude way to distinguish various levels of preference differences on each attribute. We focus on outranking methods, such as ELECTRE I, that produce a reflexive relation, interpreted as an "at least as good as" preference relation. The results in this paper may be seen as an attempt to give such outranking methods a sound axiomatic foundation based on conjoint measurement. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Power systems planning is intrinsically multiobjective in nature. The paper discusses the advantages for energy planning of approaches based on multicriteria methods. The generation expansion problem is used as an illustrative example. Two distinct methods are discussed: an interactive tricriteria linear programming tool (TRIMAP) developed at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Coimbra, and an outranking method (ELECTRE IV). The context and the aims of each method are sketched using a case study. The objectives considered in the first method are the total system cost, the environmental impact and a reliability function. In the second, a set of economic and welfare attributes are used for evaluating several alternatives which may be obtained with the aid of a screening process of the output of the first method.},

abstract={Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a multidisciplinary team-based reliability analysis tool used in a wide range of industries. However, the conventional FMEA technique has been criticized for some important deficiencies regarding risk assessments, the weights of experts and risk factors, and risk priority. Although numerous fuzzy-based modified FMEA models have been developed to improve the classical FMEA, the previous approaches lack the ability to handle internal and external uncertainties simultaneously, and they rely on extra assumptions. Hence, this study develops a novel integrated FMEA model, which can manipulate various uncertainties and unknown weights of experts and risk factors and contains more risk factors. In this model, a combination of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and rough number theory, namely intuitionistic fuzzy rough numbers, is developed to handle internal and external uncertainties of risk assessments, where IFS is used to deal with internal uncertainty, and rough number theory is employed to handle external uncertainty. Then, experts and risk factors’ overall weights involving in the FMEA technique are calculated by considering both subjective and objective aspects. In addition, a two-tier structural model containing seven risk factors is established to capture the risk information of failures more comprehensively. Finally, three practical cases to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed FMEA method are presented along with several comparisons to existing approaches. The results demonstrate that the developed method enhanced the results in terms of precise risk assessment and rational failure rankings. Additionally, its performance is superior or at least significantly compared with the original RPN, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, or rough number-FMEA methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study aims to construct a hybrid decision-making approach to the stochastic evaluation for the innovation capacity of financial institutions. For this purpose, interval type 2 fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP is used for weighting the criteria and dimensions. Additionally, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods based on interval type 2 fuzzy sets are considered to rank the alternatives. The novelty of the study is to propose a set of criteria and dimensions of innovation capacity with the supported literature. Another novelty is to propose an extended method of DEMATEL-ANP by using interval type 2 fuzzy sets as well as an integrated method of interval type 2 fuzzy stochastic decision-making with the Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that organizational dimension of innovation capacities has the highest importance between the set of criteria and the state-owned banks have been more appropriate than both the private and foreign banks for generating the innovation capacities in the financial institutions. However, the analysis illustrates that stochastic decision-making models could provide more extensive results than the conventional methods including the expert priorities. This study could be also extended by using different multicriteria decision-making methods such as MOORA and ELECTRE and also, the cross-country analysis could be applied for the future studies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Fuzzy ELECTRE (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) is one of the widely used multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method. This paper presents, the application of fuzzy ELECTRE, which will be best suited to deal with the mentioned challenges while designing an AIRS. Fuzzy ELECTRE technique will not only accomplish the precise measurement of the criteria due to the use of fuzzy but will also resolve the problem of intrusion response set prioritization. Further, the obtained prioritized response set can be utilized by the AIRS for selecting the optimum response from the prioritized response set. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

A new Comprehensive-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (C-TOPSIS) method is proposed which combines the comprehensive weights of the criteria with TOPSIS method. The proposed predictive mathematical model generates a ranking of the alternatives. An experimental study has been carried out by taking agricultural data set of rice paddy crop to demonstrate and validate the developed model. The results show significant correlation between the ranks obtained by the proposed model and the ranks obtained from the average yield per hectare. Also the results of the proposed method outperform the results of the other ranking methods, namely VIKOR and ELECTRE, particularly in the real world example. Thus, the developed predictive mathematical model seems to provide better results for the given alternatives and can also be used for other decision-making problems. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={Power generation planning seeks to achieve a reliable power system, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and social acceptability. Different alternatives of energy mixes that reflect emphasis on different strategic elements of energy policy are envisioned. For each alternative, a generation expansion pathway, comprised of different technologies introduced at different times along the planning period, is identified for each alternative considered. These pathways must be assessed in terms of multiple, sometimes conflicting, and often non-commensurate objectives. A power generation pathway can be evaluated using multiple criteria, each measured using a number of attributes. Sri Lanka, an island with no grid connection to neighboring countries and no fossil fuel reserves, currently needs to evaluate future power generation pathways. The objective of this study is to use a power capacity planning optimization model to determine details of a pathway for scheduling power plant additions for a set of alternatives and a demonstrate the use of multicriteria decision analysis method for identifying the “best” pathway for Sri Lanka. Different power generation pathways are developed and evaluated across multiple criteria and the preferences of multiple stakeholders. There is no clear winner among the pathways. A mix of renewable resources and fossil fuel constitutes an alternative that achieves energy security while satisfying multiple criteria associated with future power generation to a reasonable extent. © 2019},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to focus on the application of a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to compare results presented by the Integrated Goals System based on the 12th edition of the Integrated Public Safety Areas (IPSAs) Award, which achieved goals established for Strategic Crime Indicators for the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main objective of this research was to limit the compensatory effects of classification criteria on IPSAs that have achieved goals established for crime indicators by applying the MCDA method. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was based on the application of MCDA. The MCDA method selected and used was ELECTRE III, being implemented by J-Electre software. Findings: Compared to results of the current method, the results of the ELECTRE III method showed a 94.87 per cent change in ranking positions revealed via the SIM method. This finding denotes the elimination of compensatory effects of the criteria. As a consequence, it can be affirmed that the application of resources by IPSA managers to reduce the prevalence of a single strategic crime indicator is no longer a success factor for awarding in the established goal system. Research limitations/implications: As limitations, it is possible to indicate the time cut used to carry out the research. The research may be extended to other issues of the productivity award. Practical implications: The methodology applied with the use of ELECTRE III revealed that the government could reduce the cost with the incentive program to reduce criminal indices. Social implications: As the MCDA method is based on a binary pairwise comparison system, the methodology imposes a change of attitude on local managers fighting crime to reduce crime indicators and to consequently build a local sense of safety in IPSAs. Originality/value: This research fills a gap in the literature because there are few studies using the MCDA method in the field of public security. The value of the work lies in the creation of a method that gives the decision-maker, of the law enforcement agency, an alternative to improve the process of rewarding by productividad of the integrated areas of public security. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Priori ELECTRE TRI is a multi-criteria sorting method which places the existing alternatives in a series of predefined categories. Each category is known by two profiles that delineate the upper and lower limits of the category, and for every criterion, these profiles have a predefined value. In this paper, the ELECTRE TRI method is considered in the state of posteriori, in which, the expert first assigns the existing alternatives to the categories, and after that the value of each profile for each criterion is determined. The aim of this study is finding profiles in which all the other parameters (thresholds and cutting levels) are pre-defined. To determine the value of each criterion for each profile, a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is proposed whose objective is to maximize the lowest credibility for every profile relative to the alternatives assigned to the categories. Due to the complexity of the problem, a heuristic method and a particle swarm optimization meta-heuristic are proposed to solve the problem. Some instances of FINRISK.BDF from ELECTRE TRI software are studied to compare and evaluate the proposed methods. According to the computational experiments, the particle swarm optimization algorithm outperforms the heuristic method and can be used to solve large-scale problems effectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Managerial decision-making often involves the consideration of multiple criteria with high levels of uncertainty. Multi-attribute utility theory, a primary method proposed for decision-making under uncertainty, has been repeatedly shown to be difficult to use in practice. This paper presents a novel approach termed Simulated Uncertainty Range Evaluations (SURE) to aid decision makers in the presence of high levels of uncertainty. SURE has evolved from an existing method that has been applied extensively in the pharmaceutical and speciality chemical sectors involving uncertain decisions in whole process design. The new method utilises simulations based upon triangular distributions to create a plot which visualises the preferences and overlapping uncertainties of decision alternatives. It facilitates decision-makers to visualise the not-so-obvious uncertainties of decision alternatives. In a real-world case study for a large pharmaceutical company, SURE was compared to other widely-used methods for decision-making and was the only method that correctly identified the alternative eventually chosen by the company. The case study demonstrates that SURE can perform better than other existing methods for decision-making involving multiple criteria and uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The design of an optimal sand control method and production management is a complex problem due to the simultaneous influence of various factors. Typical effective variables for choosing an optimum sand control method include geological, technical, economical, and expert's experience on similar projects. Some technical factors, which affect the optimum method, are the type of exclusion, gravel size of gravel pack and pre-packed screen, slot width and liner slot length, and productivity index reduction. The situation could be more complicated due to the uncertainty associated with various contributing factors. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a novel approach in order to select the best sand control method with a maximum level of confidence. In this study, to select an optimal sand control method, Multi Criteria Decision Matrix (MCDM) techniques including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and, ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) are used. To simulate fluid flow, an integrated model of reservoir, well, and surface facility is used based on actual oil field data collected from the south of Iran. Then, Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) are applied to optimize the controllable variables of the best selected sand control method by MCDM. Finally, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is applied to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in order to determine the crucial factors that control net present value (NPV). The results show that the best sand control method based on AHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE is the slotted liner. After that, three different methods of pre-packed, gravel pack, and wire wrapped are respectively the most efficient sand control methods based on an average score of all the MCDM techniques. The results also indicate that although the pre-packed screen has the highest NPV, it is not the best sand control method due to the influence of other efficient criteria. The result of sensitivity analysis using MCS in terms of contribution to total variance shows that slot width, slot density, and slot height controls 60.5%, 38.8%, and 0.7% of the NPV variation within the range of factors, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

A comparative investigation is performed on only one unique model that is structured in four levels. This model has nine basic factors (Direct Normal Irradiance, grid infrastructure, climatic conditions, water availability conditions, natural disaster/hazard conditions, topographical conditions, geological conditions, land use, allocation and availability, war, terror & security conditions) taken from previous factors selection studies. There are 35 alternatives for the VLCSPP locations in Nigeria for the pre-development investment stage and are presented on Google Earth file (GE). The Super Decisions, JConcluder, DEXi and ELECTRE III-IV software are mainly used in this study. The findings show that the AHP and CDPC rankings are very close to each other. On the other hand, the DEXi, ELECTRE III and IV rankings spread very much amongst the methods. Hence, a small procedural rule is defined for the selection of candidate locations for detailed investigations. Several candidates’ VLCSPP locations were found to exist as alternatives, with approximate local central coordinates of 13°38′55.37″N, 13°20′41.41″E and 13°6′58.83″N, 13°26′53.63″E in Nigeria.

abstract={Abstract: The method of ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing Reality, ELECTRE) is a well-known and widely used outranking method for handling decision-making problems. The purpose of this paper is to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE (IVIF-ELECTRE) method and apply it to multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) involving the multiple criteria evaluation/selection of alternatives. Using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) sets with an inclusion comparison approach, concordance and discordance sets are identified for each pair of alternatives. Next, concordance and discordance indices are determined using an aggregate importance weight score function and a generalised distance measurement between weighted evaluative ratings, respectively. Based on the concordance and discordance dominance matrices, two IVIF-ELECTRE ranking procedures are developed for the partial and complete ranking of the alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated with a multiple criteria decision-making problem of watershed site selection. A comparative analysis of other MCDA methods is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IVIF-ELECTRE methods. Finally, an empirical study of job choices is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the current methods in the real world. © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

In order to resolve the problems encountered, the three types of technologies were taken into consideration with regards to the eight criteria for selecting the optimal solution. The criteria include the most important aspects of selecting the optimal technologies, such as geology and geotechnical engineering, ecology, economy, etc. In addition, AHP is used to analyse the structure of the technology selection process and to determine the significance and impact of certain criteria in the selection process, while ELECTRE method is used for the final ranking of alternatives. The obtained results indicate that the proposed combined method provides extraordinary results and that it can be used to resolve various, even the most complex problems that occur in mining engineering.},

abstract={The choice of hydraulic turbine supplier and their performance assessment are becoming major challenges. Evaluating product criterion and selecting optimum supplier are complicated tasks due to the fact that various criteria or objectives must be considered in the decision making process having various importance. Small hydropower projects (SHP) are emerging as solution for sustainable, eco-friendly, long term and cost-effective water or renewable energy resource for future. Hence such decision-making can be viewed as a multi-criteria optimization problem with correlating criteria and alternatives. This task should take into consideration several conflicting aspects because of the increasing complexity of the socio-political, technological, environmental and economic factors. Traditional single criteria decision-making approaches cannot handle the complexity of such systems. Multicriteria optimization or MCDA or MCDM methods may provide a better and flexible tool. This paper aims to evaluate applicability of multi-criteria optimization to decision makers during the small hydropower project planning and development. To the best of the author’s knowledge this novel approach for application of multi-criteria optimization in hydro turbine supplier selection are absent in renewable energy or water resource literature due to its assessment complexity. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is one of the most widely used decision methodologies. Because every kind of MCDM approach has unique strengths and weaknesses, it is difficult to determine which kind of MCDM approach is best suited to a specific problem. Therefore, a new decision-making method is proposed herein, based on linguistic information and intersection concepts; it is called the linguistic intersection method (LIM). Notably, the linguistic variables are more suited to expressing the opinion of each decision maker. There are four MCDM methods: TOPSIS, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE and VIKOR which are included in the LIM. First, each MCDM approach is used to determine the ranking order of all alternatives in accordance with the linguistic evaluations of decision makers. Then, the intersection set is determined with regard to the better alternatives of all methods. Third, the final ranking order of alternatives in the intersection set can be determined by the proposed method. Lastly, an example is given to describe the procedure of the proposed method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation test is provided to compare the LIM with the linguistic MCDM method. According to the comparison results, the proposed method is more stable in determining the ranking order of all decision alternatives. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Past and present disasters and scandals, such as the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the Servier Mediator (Benfluorex) scandal in 2009 and the Enron collapse in 2001, have uncovered weaknesses in governance issues. The authors argue that there is a need to develop methods and tools to diagnose and assess the governance of organizations with respect to Sustainable Development (SD). However, this task remains difficult due to the fact that it is difficult to appraise the quality of governance. The authors propose a protocol to diagnose and analyze the governance of SD and explore the use of multiple-criteria decision-aiding methods to achieve this task. Two aggregation methods to assess the global governance are proposed: (1) The identification of a final governance index for an Organization. This method helps in establishing a global diagnosis of the quality of the governance of an Organization with respect to SD challenges. The governance index is based on the calculation of three indexes: the partial opportunity index, the partial risk index and the partial equilibrium index. (2) The ranking of a set of Organizations according to their governance of SD. This method aims at assessing a set of Organizations based on a pairwise comparison according to a set of criteria that represents the seven domains of the ISO 26000 norm (ISO 26000-Guidance on social responsibility, 2010). This method is based on the outranking aggregation approach ELECTRE III. A practical example is used to illustrate two methods of governance assessment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Most water distribution networks are assemblies of buried elements which makes their diagnosis complex and requires implementing an asset management (AM) policy of actions performed in the short, medium and long terms. To implement such an AM, decision makers must diagnose the condition of the asset by developing specific tools for establishing priorities between assets and plan the actions needed to maintain or improve their condition. This study focuses on two topics. (i) The implementation of a spatiotemporal analysis of the propagation of pipe breaks. This innovative approach inspired by criminality analysis allows focusing on hotspot zones in order to discriminate critical assets. We have designed a new 'clustering' criterion that can be used as a prioritization criterion for asset sorting. (ii) The second part addresses the issue of multi-criteria decision making concerning the classification of pipe renewal candidates by comparing two kinds of aggregation method: (i) an unsophisticated approach by using adapted weighted sum methods; and (ii) a sophisticated approach by using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and the 'Elicitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité' (ELECTRE III). The underlying reason for comparing these methods is to know whether the unsophisticated methods ensure reliable replacement policy compared to the sophisticated one.

abstract={Ecotourism is a nature- and culture-based type of tourism. Ecotourists demand more environmentally aimed tourism experiences. Ecotourism practices should result in a non-consumptive use of natural and cultural resources. However, while ecotourism activities contribute to the visited area by generating economic benefits and educational opportunities, they may affect some resources negatively. For this reason, ecotourism must be managed by sustainability principles. Resource managers have to apply ecological, economic, social and cultural criteria when choosing their alternative ecotourism activities regarding sustainability. Inappropriate activities may damage cultural and natural elements of visited areas. To consider all dimensions of the ecotourism, planners should use multi-criteria decision-making techniques and participatory approaches to take into account social, economic and environmental dimensions of ecotourism. The techniques designed in this paper consider decision makers, the public, and sector experts' preferences in choosing alternative activities of ecotourism planning. They were evaluated using ELECTRE I (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality), ELECTRE III and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) techniques to address the same decisionmaking problems in the Cehennemdere Valley in the Mersin province. By using the AHP, ELECTRE I and III models, the preferences of stakeholders could be clarified, the ranks of the activities could be generated concerning multiple criteria, and the results of these techniques could be compared with respect to using them for sustainable ecotourism planning. This research demonstrates that the results of different decision techniques may differ when applied to the same problem. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

The technology assessment domain corresponds to the choice and applying of multi-criteria methods in supporting the decision, such as: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Attribute Failure Mode Analysis (MAFMA), Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) among others. On the other hand, the HT incorporation domain, the stages of incorporation of HT, which are divided in planning, proposal production and receiving, installation and management. From all of this, a supporting model to the decision to create indicators within the HT incorporation process, as well as to the HT management was obtained. The modeling of the incorporation process, through architecture of three domains, aids the Clinical Engineering need in managing of the medical hospital technology intending to an adequate usage. With the proposed methodology, one can obtain indicators to assist decision making in the process of HT incorporation. © 2010 IEEE.},

These pilot units were constructed in Brasilia and set in parallel, each one receiving a portion of the effluent that comes from an existing wastewater treatment plant composed of preliminary treatment, UASB reactors, and high-rate stabilisation ponds. Several evaluation criteria are used in order to relate the capabilities of the post-treatment processes to the multiple objectives in this case. Two multicriterion decision-aid methods - compromise programming and ELECTRE-III - are used to select the most satisfying processes. The top ranking alternatives are indicated for subsequent studies, considering the possible implementation of these technologies to existing plants.},

abstract={Viscous flow computations are required to predict the heat flux or the viscous drag on an hypersonic re-entry vehicle. When real gas effects are included, Navier-Stokes computations are very expensive, whereas the use of standard boundary layer approximations does not correctly account for the 'entropy layer swallowing' phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to present an extension of a new boundary layer theory, called the 'defect approach', to two-dimensional hypersonic flows including chemical and vibrational non-equilibrium phenomena. This method ensures a smooth matching of the boundary layer with the inviscid solution in hypersonic flows with strong entropy gradients. A new set of first-order boundary layer equations has been derived, using a defect formulation in the viscous region together with a matched asymptotic expansions technique. These equations and the associated transport coefficient models as well as thermochemical models have been implemented. The prediction of the flow field around the blunt-cone wind tunnel model ELECTRE with non-equilibrium free-stream conditions has been done by solving first the inviscid flow equations and then the first-order defect boundary layer equations. The numerical simulations of the boundary layer flow were performed with catalytic and non-catalytic conditions for the chemistry and the vibrational mode. The comparison with Navier-Stokes computations shows good agreement. The wall heat flux predictions are compared to experimental measurements carried out during the MSTP campaign in the ONERA F4 wind tunnel facility. The defect approach improves the skin friction prediction in comparison with a classical boundary layer computation.},

abstract={This study aims to formulate and solve discrete multicriteria decision making (D-MCDM) problems by utilizing artificial intelligent decision support systems.

Besides, based on the modulared D-MCDM method base and data base, the decision maker can flexibly choose suitable methods to solve decision problems. This paper first decomposes D-MCDM problems into alternative-attribute, attribute-criterion, criterion-method-recommendation and choice-method relationships, then transforms these relationships into 'Data', 'Function' and 'Rule' formats of logic-based programs. By following that the typical D-MCDM methods as Dominant method, Lexicographic method, Weighting method, ELECTRE method, TOPSIS method and Method with fuzzy concept are coded in a PROLOG-type language in a consistent format. Some choice rules for these D-MCDM methods are then discussed. Finally, the inference process and the man-machine dialog of this system are analyzed. © 1987.},

abstract={The main purpose of the paper is to find the sustainable solutions for crop residues burning in the northwestern states of India. Pre- and post-monsoon burning of the crop residues in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and western Uttar Pradesh increases the particulate matter significantly in the environment. During this period, the wind remains stagnant in Delhi NCR (National Capital Region) which creates an airlock situation in this region. The air quality during this period becomes very poor. It is a major health issue in the northern part of the country, especially in NCR Delhi which is densely populated and industrialized. It has become a major concern for the state as well as central government. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review the factors forcing the farmers to burn the crop residues in the field and analyze the solutions considering the social and economic sustainability of the farmers. A focus group discussion composed of farmers, academicians, and industry experts has been used to get the opinion regarding the solutions for crop residues burning in the field. For an analysis of the information collected, a hybrid approach of analytic hierarchy process and elimination and choice expressing reality have been used. Based on the analysis, it is observed that use of crop residues for the preparation of biogas, biochar, and bioethanol is the most preferred substitute, whereas use as fuel for the thermal power plant is the second preferred substitute for use of crop residues. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This paper develops a novel multi-criteria group decision-making method for resolving single-valued neutrosophic group decision-making problems with unknown weight information. Firstly, considering the different knowledge backgrounds of decision-makers (DMs), two distance-based methods are developed to obtain the weights of DMs and criteria. One of these methods focuses on the closeness between the decision matrix given by an individual DM and that of the group judgment, and the proximity between the decision matrix given by an individual DM and the matrices given by all the other DMs to determine the weights of DMs with respect to each criterion. The other method extends the maximizing deviation method to objectively obtain the weights of criteria. Secondly, an extended ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) II is investigated to effectively circumvent the issue that criteria cannot compensate for each other. In this method, three levels of concordance and discordance sets are constructed to fully denote the underlying preference information and specify the outranking degrees of alternatives. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, followed by a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis to test its robustness and effectiveness. © 2020, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

abstract={The challenge of promoting sustainable cities and reaching the objectives developed by the European Green Deal includes the renovation of the building sector, as it is responsible for 40% of energy consumption in Europe. Regional or local public administrations have to allocate their financial resources for improving the energy performances of their building stock and to face a multidimensional problem, where different aspects – such as energy efficiency, financial-economic feasibility and environmental protection – have to be harmonized. The present study proposes a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding model, which includes the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, for supporting the public decision process of sorting alternative energy retrofitting actions into various categories, each of them expresses different levels of overall performance. The model is applied to an Italian real case study. An experts’ panel has been involved for structuring the decision problem and discussing the results. The results show that opaque envelope insulation actions are often classified in best categories to be implemented and funded instead the upgrade of the lighting system falls in the worst category. These results are useful for local or regional public administrations to select those energy retrofitting actions that have to be financed as a priority. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We present two new interval-based extensions of ELECTRE TRI-nB and ELECTRE TRI-nC, in which the preference relations are built by using the interval outranking approach. The boundaries between adjacent classes (or categories) are described by a set of limiting profiles, whose criteria could take on values which are interval numbers. Compared to INTERCLASS (a recently proposed interval-based ordinal classification method), the assignments suggested by our first extension come from enhanced preference relations between the actions and limiting boundaries and are likely to be more appropriate. In addition, it can suggest assignments from a pseudo-conjunctive logic. In our second extension, each class is characterized by a set of representative actions, again allowing interval numbers as criterion scores. The outranking relations between actions and classes are enhanced by having several representative actions in each category. Both new extensions can handle imperfect knowledge of the model parameters (weights, veto thresholds, credibility threshold), even missing criterion scores. Some fundamental properties and results are proved to guarantee the consistency of the methods, which are also illustrated with some numerical examples. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Decision making in food safety is a complex process that involves several criteria of different nature like the expected reduction in the number of illnesses, the potential economic or health-related cost, or even the environmental impact of a given policy or intervention. Several multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms are currently used, mostly individually, in food safety to rank different options in a multifactorial environment. However, the selection of the MCDA algorithm is a decision problem on its own because different methods calculate different rankings. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of different uncertainty sources on the rankings of MCDA problems in the context of food safety. For that purpose, a previously published data set on emerging zoonoses in the Netherlands was used to compare different MCDA algorithms: MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, WASPAS, and ELECTRE III. The rankings were calculated with and without considering uncertainty (using fuzzy sets), to assess the importance of this factor. The rankings obtained differed between algorithms, emphasizing that the selection of the MCDA method had a relevant impact in the rankings. Furthermore, considering uncertainty in the ranking had a high influence on the results. Both factors were more relevant than the weights associated with each criterion in this case study. A hierarchical clustering method was suggested to aggregate results obtained by the different algorithms. This complementary step seems to be a promising way to decrease extreme difference among algorithms and could provide a strong added value in the decision-making process. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis},

This paper proposes a model for improving quality management through the assessment and ranking of manufacturing subprocesses with respect to key performance indicators (KPIs). The developed model, supported with the fuzzy extended ELECTRE III, allows for the determination of subprocesses' rank. An illustrative example indicates that the proposed model could be very useful in everyday business operations as total quality management asset. The model can handle all uncertain and vague input data by applying the theory of fuzzy sets. The research also suggests different managerial implications because it provides an adequate tool for overall quality improvement. The number of treated KPIs is relatively high, so ELECTRE III method gives an advantage over other multicriteria analysis methods because it embraces less subjective thinking and demands slightly less experts' knowledge during the process of decision making and assessment. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={The present study aims to make a comparative study of the selection of mining method using five multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models (TOPSIS, VIKOR, improved ELECTRE, PROMETHEE II, and WPM). Underground mining method selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, and the mine planners face the challenges in the selection of the appropriate mining method. The selection of mining method depends on multiple intrinsic factors (dip, shape, thickness, depth, grade distribution, RMR of ore, RMR of hanging wall, and RMR of footwall) and extrinsic factors (available technology). The study considered only intrinsic factors in selection of mining method. In the last few decades, many multi-criteria decision-making models have been developed. The study uses AHP technique for determining the weights of the effective criteria. The proposed techniques were implemented for Tummalapalle mine of Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), India. The results revealed that mining methods selected were not uniform. Actually it is a case of room and pillar being the preferred method by three of the MCDM models, while it is a second or equal preference method in two of the MCDM models applied. © 2018, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={Data processing techniques for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) image mining provide essential information to optimize maintenance management of Water Supply Systems (WSSs). These techniques aim to elaborate on radargrams in order to produce meaningful graphical representations of critical buried components of WSSs. These representations are helpful non-destructive evaluation tools to prevent possible failures in WSSs by keeping them adequately monitored. This paper proposes an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach to prioritize various data processing techniques by means of ranking their outputs, namely their resulting GPR image representations. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied to weight various evaluation criteria, with the purpose of managing vagueness and uncertainty characterizing experts’ judgments. Then, the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la RÉalité III (ELECTRE III) method is used to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. A real case study, focusing on a set of four GPR images as outputs of different data processing techniques, is presented to prove the usefulness of the proposed hybrid approach. In particular, the GPR images are ranked according the evaluation of five criteria namely visualization, interpretation, identification of features, extraction of information and affordability. The findings offer a structured support in selecting the most suitable data processing technique(s) to explore WSS underground. In the presented case, two options, namely the variance filter and the subtraction methods, offer the best results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The material selection of prostheses in developing countries is currently biased towards what is readily available and ignores important criteria such as patient comfort and structural strength. In this study, the ELECTRE III multiple attribute decision-making method was applied to the material selection of a paediatric prosthetic knee. Light metals were considered as candidates for selection. While composites are light, they are not suitable for use in components with sliding and mating surfaces such as a prosthetic knee. Plastics are prone to failure. Candidate materials were evaluated on criteria related to patient fatigue and comfort, structural stability and material cost. The patient fatigue and comfort requirement was evaluated using material density as the weight of the prosthesis affects the comfort level. Finite element analyses simulating the ISO 10328:2006 standard for structural testing of lower limb prostheses were used to evaluate the structural strength suitability of the candidate materials. The present day prices of the raw material of the candidates were used as an index of material cost. Wrought aluminium alloy aluminium 7175 was ranked highest while titanium alloys were ranked below these due to their higher cost. Cast aluminium alloys ranked lowest due to their poor structural performance. The study, using ELECTRE III, a rigorous multi-criteria decision analysis method, shows that aluminium 7175 is the optimal light metal material for a paediatric prosthetic knee. © 2015, © IMechE 2015.},

abstract={Optimum operating parameters for pulse co-deposition of nano-Al2O3 with Cr from a trivalent chromium bath onto Cu cathode are selected by using “technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution” (TOPSIS), “VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje” (VIKOR), “elimination and choice expressing the reality” (ELECTRE) and “complex proportional assessment” (CORPAS) accompanied with analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) to compare methods for achievement of the best tribological coating performance. Criteria for appropriate selection include wear loss, corrosion resistance, micro-hardness, bath condition and current efficiency. Results ascertain the best Cr–Al2O3 nano-composite coating with 40% duty cycle, 10 Hz current frequency and 1 g/L nano-Al2O3 dispersed into the electrolyte bath. Comparison of the different calculated Speraman's coefficients weighed with the «subjective» analytic hierarchy process indicates more consistent results than «objective» entropy technique. The study clarifies the comparative capability of the weighing and the ranking methods in choosing the best way to make consistent final results independent of the level of knowledge and standpoints of the researchers. Recommendation of subjective rather than objective weighing apparatus to the MCDM researchers is therefore a constructive achievement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to rank the agro-energy regions according to their potentials of biomass production in the Region of Central Macedonia (RCM). For this reason, a model of Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCDA) is developed with the ELimination and Et Choix Traduisant la REalite (ELECTRE) III method, with the construction of outranking relations. The aim is to compare in a comprehensive way each pair of action, in our case the agro-energy regions of the RCM, in order to satisfy the main goal which is to rank the seven regions as regards their biomass production. The final goal is to select the optimal crop plan as a pilot case for biomass production in the region. In the case of ELECTRE III multicriteria model, we used several conflicting criteria such as the farm income, the biomass production from crop residues, the variable costs, and the production of thermal energy and electrical energy. Alongside a technical and economic analysis of the study area is conducted for the existent crop plans of each agro-energy region. The results show that agro-energy regions with cereals and arable crops have better results than regions with fruit trees and other crops. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper describes an integrated decision analysis method to support the managing board to define a restructuring plan for a small oil refinery in south Brazil. The refinery is facing an extreme crisis situation due to the obsolescence of its production plant. The decision approach proposed in this paper consists of four phases. Initially, potentially performing restructuring alternatives were identified, as well a set of criteria covering the dimensions of corporate sustainability. Based on the relative importance evaluation of each criteria given by a group of decision-makers, and on the performance of the alternatives in each of the criteria, a fuzzy decision-making method, called FETOPIS, was applied for ranking the alternatives. The information resulting from this analysis, along with economic data, was used in a portfolio optimization model to identify restructuring investment projects (RIPs), a combination of feasible restructuring alternatives. FETOPSIS was used again to generate overall performance scores of each RIP, aggregating the individual performances of the constituent alternatives. The application of the method in the refinery demonstrated the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach to facilitate the understanding and exploitation of the problem, considering simultaneously several distinct and conflicting dimensions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

This activity involves a certain level of risk as payback period of investments are very critical and correct decision on selection of companies to be invested determines success of top management of investors and also creditors. As management requires solid techniques and methods for selection of correct candidate to be invested, application of decision making methods will contribute to this process and reduce the possibility of wrong investments. In this article an investment group's local acquisition opportunities are evaluated by ELECTRE (Elimination et choix traduisant la realite) method. In this case there are four alternatives that are accepting same price and other contractual requirements. This paper lists six important criteria that have influence on local acquisition alternatives' selection in Turkey according to references: Financial performance, accreditations and authorizations, Administrative and accounting, technical infrastructure, staff expertise and experience, customer portfolio.

abstract={This paper aims to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool for rainwater harvesting (RWH) on a university campus in Bogota, Colombia. The specific type of MCDA our research proposes is known as CRIDE (multi-CRIteria DEcision support tool), which allows us to study various methods of RWH. In order to account for uncertainties such as the variability of expert opinions and imprecision stemming from the different criteria required, we have designed this tool to incorporate ELECTRE II and the Monte Carlo method. For this case study we apply a methodology that evaluates the performance of six RWH scenarios. These six input scenarios emerged from an ideal one, wherein all rainwater throughout the campus is successfully harvested and treated until potable. From there, reality sets in: the other five scenarios are varying degrees of deviance from the ideal one, both in terms of water quantity and quality. In regard to collection and treatment we used sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). As for the evaluation of each of the scenarios, we outline eight criteria, which include hydraulic performance, compatibility with the University's Master Plan and financial aspects. Our research concludes that CRIDE as a means of support during the decision-making process generates a complete view of possible solutions, in addition to ranking these solutions. The CRIDE-based approach allows for the proposal of a methodology that evaluates the relevance of an established criteria set, using robustness, redundancy and sensitivity. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Decision making is to an increasing extent supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) software. Especially when a ranking of objects (chemicals, geographical units, nations, strategies etc) is wanted, an initial step is the development of a multi-indicator system (MIS). One of the famous MCDA concepts to obtain a ranking from MIS is realized in the series of ELECTRE-algorithms. The major task of decision support systems is to obtain a total order. On the other hand, an evaluation of MIS by partial order leads to directed graphs, where objects often are not connected, i.e., not being comparable with each other. In the partial order terminology this relation is called 'incomparability'. Partial order does a priori not lead to a total order, which is most often seen as a severe disadvantage. The reason for incomparabilities among objects can be traced back either to conceptual conflicts, or simply to small, even minute data differences. The software ELECTRE III (and others of the ELECTRE family) takes care for these latter cases by a set of parameters beyond the data matrix and functions describing the degree of user preferences. In that sense ELECTRE III can be (and is) seen as a fuzzy method. In partial order theory fuzzy concepts can be inferred too. The present study compares the results of ELECTRE (simplified) and of fuzzy partial order theory. As an example a group of environmentally hazardous chemicals is selected. It turns out that the concept of fuzzy posets provides an effective instrument to reduce the number of incomparabilities, without the need of additional parameters beyond those of the data matrix as is the case in ELECTRE III. © 2015 MATCH Commun.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a model to guide organizations according to the relative importance of customer's satisfaction about six quality service dimensions: reliability, empathy, assurance, tangibility, responsiveness (Parasuraman et al., 1985) and price. Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses SERVPERF customer requirements and weights of ELECTRE TRI multicriteria method to provide guidance on an appropriated action plan. Subsequently, it was demonstrated how the proposed model applied to the Inn. Findings: SERVPERF is based on the subjective and cognitive perception of customer's service analyses. ELECTRE TRI decreases the deviation of subjectivity and develops manager's energy flow, focussed on enterprise resources. Research limitations/implications: Measuring quality is hard work and usually the customer perceptions are not well understood, because it changes many times. In addition SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI weights do not order the quality importance. Practical implications: Together, SERVPERF and ELECTRE TRI allow managers to prioritize the service level desired by the customer. Originality/value: The importance of this analysis follows the competitiveness approach: productivity, quality and flexibility (Boljwin and Kumpe, 1990). The paper develops an approach to lead organizational quality performance based on the customer view. It provides a sustainable competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Decision tasks are often characterized by the presence of multiple and conflicting criteria used for judging a finite set of alternatives. From such a decision making context arises the need for practical procedures helping the decision maker (DM) doing the right selection, assignment or ranking. Over the last few decades, various Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) procedures have been proposed and used in order to respond to such decision aiding tasks. A major criticism of these different methods is that they may yield different results when applied to the same problem. A comparative study is proposed here to identify similarities and divergences between a number of most used MCDM methods. A case study from the literature concerned with seismic structural retrofitting of a reinforced concrete (RC) building and for which eight conflicting criteria are taken into account, is presented. Obtained results employing six MCDM methods (ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE I and II, TOPSIS, AHP and PEG-MCDM) are compared. A Gini index is introduced to quantify dispersion of Pareto optima ranking provided by various applied methods. The results highlight the sensitivity of the best Pareto compromise design and ranking to the applied MCDM method. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Evaluating and comparing the threats and vulnerabilities associated with territorial zones according to multiple criteria (industrial activity, population, etc.) can be a time-consuming task and often requires the participation of several stakeholders. Rather than a direct evaluation of these zones, building a risk assessment scale and using it in a formal procedure permits to automate the assessment and therefore to apply it in a repeated way and in large-scale contexts and, provided the chosen procedure and scale are accepted, to make it objective. One of the main difficulties of building such a formal evaluation procedure is to account for the multiple decision makers' preferences. The procedure used in this article, Electre Tri, uses the performances of each territorial zone on multiple criteria, together with preferential parameters from multiple decision makers, to qualitatively assess their associated risk level. We also present operational tools in order to implement such a procedure in practice, and show their use on a detailed example. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A new material selection approach based on PROMETHEE method is proposed in this paper. Compared with ELECTRE method, this PROMETHEE can utilize more candidate information, thus making the selection result more reasonable. The approach is further illustrated and validated by two material selection cases. And Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is used to describe the correlation coefficients between material selection results obtained by PROMETHEE and that by other methods. This paper provides further evidence for the assertion that MCDM theory has the potential to improve material selection method. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Considering the significant growth in mobile phone use by customers and its high accessibility, this device can be considered as the most suitable tool in payment category. To implement a mobile payment service, there are many actors involved such as: bank, operator and service provider. As an effective interaction role and in order to optimize efficient parameters for implementing a mobile payment solution, it is necessary to present a suitable business model. Therefore, five different business models have been surveyed in the field of mobile payment in this research; then they were compared with MCDM evaluation method applications. Since one of the most effective parameter to select an appropriate business model is the banks / operators' structure of every country, the proposed business model in this paper is localized based on Iranian banks / operators' framework. The results of MCDM method indicate that the collaboration model is the most suitable mobile payment business model in Iran. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, end user (farmer) and decision maker (water allocator) opinions were surveyed and a conjoint analysis (CA) based method was applied to the quantitative and qualitative data to assess the utility associated with each attribute that plays a role in forming the final thinking of the water users. The application of CA for estimating the utility for each attribute level is a novel approach, which helps provide a formal, objective basis for assigning relative scales for each attribute interval within a multiattribute decision-making model. The utilities (part-worths) obtained from the CA have a cardinal scale and were found to be comparable within and across the attributes. A farmers' survey on five water allocation attributes was completed from 62 farmers and their opinions on the relative importance of attributes were elicited for a subarea of the Indus River Basin. The CA method was then applied to the survey data and the utilities for each attribute level were determined. This allowed, for instance, decisions to be made, which take account of the perceived value of the water and of the availability of local labor to work on the farm. Finally, these interval scales were used within the specification of the ELECTRE multiattribute decision-making method to provide a complete and objective ranking of nine irrigation districts so that the best decisions on water allocation could be made. © 2010 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract={In the past few decades several wide-area and local-area wireless access technologies have emerged. Network convergence across these different access technologies holds a promise of enabling ubiquitous service availability but faces several technical challenges. With anticipated proliferation of multimode IP devices, the optimal selection of a service delivery network among multiple IP-based wireless access alternatives is one of the important issues that is actively studied and discussed in several standardization forums. Use of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms has been proposed in the past for network selection decisions in a heterogeneous wireless network environment. A direct comparison of these algorithms is difficult as this would require the use of another MADM algorithm. A better approach instead is to ascertain the appropriateness of the algorithm to the problem space. This chapter provides the basis for evaluating the appropriateness of MADM algorithms for network selection. It analyzes the use of MADM algorithms such as TOPSIS, ELECTRE and GRA for network selection and argues that GRA provides the best approach in scenarios where the utilities of some of the attributes are non-monotonic. We propose a novel stepwise approach for GRA that uses multiple reference networks and explain how it works with network selection scenarios. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.},

abstract={In contemporary discrete product design, to fulfil some of the design requirements (such as mechanical, thermal, etc.), the material properties (such as material composition) of a design should be graded so that a functionally graded material (FGM) object is produced. With the advent of solid freeform fabrication (SFF) or layer manufacturing (LM) technologies, FGM objects are now possible and there different modelling schemes are proposed for modelling and representing an FGM object. However, determining the proper material composition of an object is an issue to be considered and methodology must be investigated. In the current paper, a methodology is proposed and used to determine the material composition of the model based on the computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis results. The issue of material composition selection is formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem and one of the MCDM methods - ELECTRE III - is employed in the proposed methodology for identifying the optimal material composition alternative for different regions of the model. Applying the methodology, an FGM object will be produced and a reinforced FGM prototype can be fabricated by an appropriate LM process. Apart from the FGM object, the application of the proposed methodology in rapid tooling (RT) will also be discussed. © IMechE 2008.},

abstract={The problem of fitting a probability distribution, here log-Pearson Type III distribution, to extreme floods is considered from the point of view of two numerical and three non-numerical criteria. The six techniques of fitting considered include classical techniques (maximum likelihood, moments of logarithms of flows) and new methods such as mixed moments and the generalized method of moments developed by two of the co-authors. The latter method consists of fitting the distribution using moments of different order, in particular the SAM method (Sundry Averages Method) uses the moments of order 0 (geometric mean), 1 (arithmetic mean), -1 (harmonic mean) and leads to a smaller variance of the parameters. The criteria used to select the method of parameter estimation are:- the two statistical criteria of mean square error and bias; - the two computational criteria of program availability and ease of use; - the user-related criterion of acceptability. These criteria are transformed into value functions or fuzzy set membership functions and then three Multiple Criteria Decision Modelling (MCDM) techniques, namely, composite programming, ELECTRE, and MCQA, are applied to rank the estimation techniques. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Hydrogen has been received more and more attentions because of its advantage in terms of low environmental impact and high energy density. However, the sustainability priorities of different hydrogen production pathways have not been determined. To assist the sustainability-oriented selection of hydrogen production pathways, a prioritization framework needs to be built. However, the data collected from different sources consisting of hybrid information, such as crisp numbers, interval numbers, and fuzzy numbers, increases the difficulty of sustainability-oriented decision-making. Therefore, this study aims to develop a sustainability prioritization framework for hydrogen production pathways under hybrid information. The Z-number Best Worst Method (ZBWM) is applied to quantify the weight of each criterion from the views of decision-makers in the forms of Z-number. The ELECTRE method has been extended to prioritize the alternatives under the context of hybrid information. An illustrative case including five hydrogen production processes is used to illustrate the proposed prioritization framework from environmental, social, economic, and technical aspects, and the results show that biomass hydrogen technology is the most sustainable choice. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed model, other three multi-criteria decision making methods were also used to determine the sustainability rankings of these five hydrogen production pathways, and the comparisons reveal that this method is feasible. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract={An important issue for ensuring a nation's economic security involves evaluating the supply risk of its strategic mineral resources. Considering the impact of strategic emerging industries on the supply risk of China's strategic minerals, this study establishes an indicator system for evaluating such risks. Specifically, using stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis for the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité TRI method, this study systematically evaluates the supply risk of 14 strategic metallic mineral resources in China from 2008 to 2017 and through 2025. The results indicate that: 1) From 2008 to 2017, the supply risk level of molybdenum and rare earth elements were low or low-to-medium, and those of 12 other minerals were high or medium-to-high; 2) For copper, gold, tungsten, molybdenum, antimony, and lithium, the supply risk level increased, and that for nickel decreased, while for iron, tin, chromium, and rare earth elements it irregularly fluctuated; and 3) The supply risk of chromium, molybdenum, lithium, and rare earth elements was influenced by potentially higher risk factors caused by poor substitutability and low recycling rate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The coordination in post-disaster functions is a major challenge for the humanitarian supply chains. Due to uncertainty and temporary nature of the disasters, it becomes very difficult to ensure coordination among the aid organizations engaged in the humanitarian supply chain. The increasing incidents of the natural, technological and man-made disasters have attracted the attention of the researchers, governmental and non-governmental actors. Most of the disasters are not under the control of the human being. Some of the man-made disasters also create a huge loss of the human lives with damages to the public and private properties due to some social and political causes. From literature, it is observed that the technologies of Industry 4.0 may help in improving the coordination among stakeholders of the commercial supply chains but the application of industry 4.0 technologies in humanitarian relief chains is not well explored. Therefore, the present study has bridged the existing research gaps by exploring the application of Industry 4.0 technologies for improving the coordination in humanitarian supply chains. A hybrid approach comprising of Analytic Hierarchy Process and ELECTRE has been used to propose a strategic approach for mapping the measures of coordination with critical success factors. Findings of the study will help stakeholders of humanitarian supply chains in implementing Industry 4.0 technologies across different functions for prompt service and accurate decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: The food industry is crucial in delivering healthy products for life saving of the society. The identification of key barriers of knowledge management (KM) is desired to enhance the sustainability of the industry. KM has been seen as a part of sustainable development by reducing the bullwhip effect in the entire supply chain. The core objective of the existing research is to prioritize the essential factors of KM adoption in sustainable supply chain (SSC) based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method. Design/methodology/approach: In order to fulfill objectives of this study, an extensive review of literature and a questionnaire-based field visits were conducted. A total of five major barriers categories and 22 sub-barriers categories were identified in food sector of Pakistan using experts' inputs. This study employed fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Findings: Managerial barriers, innovation and technological barriers categories are found to be highly prioritized among others. Further, the sensitivity analysis is applied to check the incremental changes of ranked barriers. This prioritization of barriers and incremental changes in them is expected to serve food sector for long-term sustainability and competitive advantage for importers and exporters. Finally, the findings of this research are very helpful for industrial experts, practitioners, consultants and government officials in effectively developing policies regarding KM adoption in line with sustainable goals. Research limitations/implications: The present work is conducted in the Pakistani context; however, the benchmark model may be tested and applied to other developing countries to compare the outcomes. For further research, the identified barriers may also be evaluated to establish their inter-relationships, using ISM, DEMATEL, ANP, etc. Similarly, the results of this study can also be compared with that of other fuzzy multi-criteria techniques like fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy VIKOR, fuzzy ELECTRE, fuzzy PROMETHEE, or fuzzy VIKOR. Practical implications: This research study can facilitate policymakers, government bodies, stakeholders and supply chain professionals to recognize the key barriers they may encounter in adopting KM practices in their SSC. Additionally, this work helps managers to evaluate the identified barriers by computing their relative importance in adopting KM practices at managerial levels like strategically, tactically and operationally activities in business. This study also facilitates industrial management in formulating policies and action plans in case of implementation, eliminating the barriers in adoption of KM, and SSC successfully. Originality/value: Few research studies were conducted on KM adoption in industries of China, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, but due to workforce diversity these industries have dissimilar views of experts about KM adoption. This study significantly contributed to fill the existing literature gap for prioritization of key barriers against KM implementation in Pakistani context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={ABC analysis is a widespread inventory management technique designed to classify inventory items—based on their weighted scores—into three ordered categories A, B and C, where category A contains the most important items and category C includes the least important ones. This paper proposes a new ABC classification approach which involves a non-compensatory aggregation procedure, based on a simplified ELECTRE III method, to compute the score of each inventory item. A non-compensatory aggregation scheme means that the bad scores of an item on some significant criteria could not be offset by its high performances on the other criteria. This way of proceeding prohibits this kind of items from being classified into good categories and therefore generates a more realistic ABC classification of inventory items. Since the application of the simplified ELECTRE III method requires the knowledge of some parameter values, the continuous variable neighborhood search meta-heuristic will be used for their estimation. The comparative study—conducted on two real datasets—shows that the classification of items produced by our proposed approach has generated the lowest inventory cost value among those produced by all tested classification models. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this study, the ranges of criteria weights based on the outranking relations in ELECTRE I and II methods are analyzed, which is considered as the sensitivity analysis regarding criteria weights. First, an important theorem is proved, in which the maximum value of discordance indices for any two alternatives is shown to be equal to 1. Using this theorem, four situations of outranking relations for any two alternatives are simplified to two situations when sensitivity analysis of criteria weights is performed for ELECTRE I. Subsequently, some inequalities are obtained to calculate the ranges of criteria weights when keeping the outranking relations between any two alternatives unchanged. For ELECTRE II, nine situations of strong and weak outranking relations are simplified into three situations of relations according to this theorem. The ranges of criteria weights are also derived when the strong and weak outranking relations remain unchanged. Finally, two examples are presented to test and verify the effectiveness of the sensitivity analysis of criteria weights for ELECTRE I. Two analogous examples are also presented in ELECTRE II. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study proposed a bifacial photovoltaic thermal system (BPV/T) design. The two quality properties of electrical and thermal efficiency are important characteristics in the overall performance of the BPV/T. The relationship of the important parameters, including collector material, number of collectors, diameter, storage tank volume/surface area ratio, mass flow rate, cycle temperature, and azimuth angle, with respect to the quality characteristic of the BPV/T system was discussed. The Taguchi Method was used for the experimental plan, and the Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) software was applied for theoretical simulation. At the same time, the Main Effect Analysis (MEA) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were combined to review the influence of setup parameters on the electrical and thermal efficiency. The single quality optimization setup parameter combinations were obtained. For objective multiple criteria analysis, the objective weights of electrical and thermal efficiency are obtained from the analytical data of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Afterwards, the Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) will be employed to obtain the optimized parameter combinations for each season throughout the year. The practical validation is performed according to the multi-quality optimization setup parameter combination. The maximum errors in both the electrical and thermal efficiency between practical validation and simulation test are smaller than 4.3%. Then, the economic and footprint analysis of the BPV/T system was compared with both 1 kW photovoltaic (PV) and photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) systems. Based on the 20-year warranty of the PV module, in terms of economic benefit, the BPV/T system is higher than the PV/T system by 18% and higher than PV by 460%. In terms of footprint analysis, BPV/T is less than PV and PV/T by 11%; however, the overall energy output per unit area of BPV/T is 20% and 210% higher than PV/T and PV, respectively. In the future, the optimized parameters and benefits analysis of the BPV/T system from this study will be further applied to the planning of solar energy technology as a point of reference for end users or industrial communities to accelerate the development of BPV/T for the renewable energy market. © 2019},

abstract={Manufacturing industry plays a very significant role in the economic functioning of any country. In recent times, reverse engineering (RE) has become an integral part of manufacturing set-up owing to its numerous applications. The quality of RE product primarily depends on the quality of digitization i.e., part measurement. There is a diverse range of digitization devices which can be employed in RE. These machines have variability in terms of cost, accuracy, ease of use, accessibility, scanning time, etc. Therefore, the decision regarding the selection of a suitable device becomes important in a particular RE application. The decisions taken in the planning stage for RE can have a long lasting impact on the functionality, quality and the economics of components to be used by manufacturing industries. To accomplish the selection procedure, a comparative study of three digitization techniques has been carried out. The determination of an appropriate digitization system is basically a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. MCDM techniques are yet to be applied in the selection of digitization systems for RE. MCDM is one of the most widely used decision methodologies in business and engineering spheres. The aim of this work is to describe various MCDM methods in the selection of digitization systems for RE. This paper intends to employ combinations between different MCDM methods such as group eigenvalue method (GEM), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy method, elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE), technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simple additive weighing (SAW) method. In this work, GEM, AHP, Entropy methods has been used to elicit weights of various selection criteria, while TOPSIS, ELECTRE and SAW have been applied to rank the alternatives. A comparative analysis has also been performed to determine the efficacies of different approaches. The conclusion of the paper reveals the best digitization system as well as the characteristics of different MCDM methods and their suitability in RE application. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Decision making highly influences peoples’ lives and their activities. Unfortunately, nowadays decision-making process is very often affected by feeling of uncertainty and risk, whereas decision problems have become increasingly complex. In these circumstances, the meaning of ‘intelligence’ aspect is gaining an importance as it highly enhances the possibility of making the right decision. Additionally, intelligent decision-making models are very useful in various sectors of economy, including transportation sector. The typical decision problem may be e.g. the process of evaluating and selecting transportation system, which is being defined as a set of different types of elements, relationships and processes. One of the transport’s element is transport facility point - especially car fleet (different kinds of vehicles). Selection of the most desired vehicles may determine the success of the whole transportation system for the company. Therefore, the process of evaluating and selecting the used fleet should be carefully considered and based on the intelligent approach. Also, various types of tools/techniques for intelligent decision making can be used e.g. Multiple Criteria Decision Making, Group Decision Making, Artificial Neural Networks, Metaheuristic, Fuzzy Logic, Case – Based Reasoning and Expert Systems. In the case study described, the author implements MCDM Methodology (especially Electre III/IV method) in order to make the right decision during selection of the most desired variant/type of the vehicle. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new Human Development Index (HDI) classification method using as a basis the same dimensions and weights used by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), however, avoiding the compensatory effect and misclassification that can occur when UNDP approach is applied. The proposed approach also allows working with any set of dimensions and weights. The classification was performed by the Elimination Et Choix Traidusaint la Realite (ELECTRE TRI), a multicriteria method, in which classes were defined with the visual aid of a non-parametrically tool, the Kernel Density Estimation and the class profiles were calculated by the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm. The proposed classification method achieved better results than the one adopted by the UNDP, because the countries could be classified accurately in their natural classes without occurring the compensation effect. However, when comparing with the HDI index we have obtained an accuracy of 76.60% for the first proposed model and 78.72% for the second one. Our proposal purely used the same dimensions and weights adopted by UNDP. The proposed method is more robust, closer to reality and can eliminate the compensatory effect between dimensions, thus it can provide more credibility to the HDI. The combination of the ELECTRE TRI method with statistical tools to define classes and class profiles for the HDI is unprecedented in the literature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Process sustainability is one of the major concerns in the process systems engineering area. Addressing this concept inevitably requires a multi-objective analysis to evaluate the social and environmental impacts in addition to the usual economic performance objective. Furthermore, the final sustainability of the proposed solutions very often depends on uncertain conditions, especially in the very frequent case that renewable resources are considered in order to enhance environmental sustainability: these resources are usually affected by unpredictable variations in their quality/quantity availability. But the approaches presented for solving multi-objective problems under uncertainty are limited by the amount of scenarios required to represent the unknown conditions. Here it is presented a solution strategy that combines a scenario reduction algorithm within the framework of a multi-objective formulation. Such a strategy is able to produce a fast and robust multi-objective optimization (MOO) while considering uncertainty in the raw material conditions (more precisely quality and availability). The solutions forming the resulting set of Pareto solutions are sorted hierarchically using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality IV (ELECTRE IV) method, which identifies the ones showing better overall performance considering the uncertain parameters space. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Decision-making for the selection of treatment alternatives and landfilling of municipal solid waste (MSW) is based on the experience and judgment of those management responsible, without considering multicriteria analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the treatment scenario and landfilling of MSW with the lowest environmental and economic costs in a medium-sized city. The methodology included the definition and data processing of the project (population, generation, and composition of MSW), for 16 years. In the design of scenarios, recycling, composting, incineration with energy recovery, and landfilling treatments were proposed; later, the combinations of treatments for each type of residue were generated. The results showed 36 scenarios, then the ELECTRE method was applied to the five with the lowest economical and environmental costs. Finally from the latter, one dominant scenario was determined: organic waste in composting; plastic, paper, and glass in recycling; and 'others' in landfilling. It is concluded that the final decision on the scenario is adapted to the particular conditions of the locality. © 2017 by the authors.},

The huge number of extracted association rules represents the main problem that a decision maker can face. Hence, the knowledge post-processing phase becomes very important and challenging to define the most interesting association rules, many interestingness measures have been proposed. Currently, there is no optimal measure that can be selected to evaluate the extracted association rules. To bypass this problem, we propose an approach based on multi-criteria optimization aiming to find a good compromise without excluding any measures. The experiments performed on numerous benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm is properly reducing a large number of association rules and keeping the most significant and interesting ones compared to other approaches which illustrate the efficiency and the applicability our approach.},

abstract={The determination of the optimal purchasing strategy in enterprise that is a part of global supply chain could be performed in two steps. In step one, a classification of potential suppliers is performed in order to determine the optimal portfolio of suppliers. This is delivered by using the fuzzy multicriteria proposed ABC classification method. Uncertainties in relative importance of criteria and their values are described by linguistic expressions. Modelling of linguistic expressions is based on the fuzzy sets theory. In the second step, ranking of optimal portfolio of suppliers is performed by using the modified ELECTRE method. The obtained results represent valuable input for determining the long time purchasing strategy and building partnership with the best suppliers. The developed two-step model is verified on real life data. The obtained results indicate good compliance with the opinions management in this type of industry. It is worth to mention that the proposed model can be easily extended and adopted to the analysis of other issues of management which could be applicable in different research areas. © 2016 Petar Kefer et al.},

abstract={Ranking the companies can be a useful guide for investors to select an optimum portfolio. Tehran stock exchange (TSE) uses liquidity criterion to rank the companies; however, this study shows that preferences of investors, the criteria they use to evaluate companies’ performances, and the extent to which ranking of companies based on investors’ criteria are in line with the ranking announced by the stock exchange. Since the criteria used for ranking the companies are various and often conflicting and because each multiple criteria technique has its own specific characteristics, various rankings are offered. Therefore, it is required to utilize multiple criteria decision making models to avoid confusion of investors. For this purpose, some companies were selected from 50 top companies listed in 2011 in TSE, which maintained the reliability of their ranks and finally, 20 companies were selected and were ranked based on investors’ criteria using EECTRE III Technique. The obtained ranking was then compared with the ranking offered by stock exchange. Research results indicate that ELECTRE III technique was a useful and efficient method to select a portfolio. Moreover, valuebased criteria as well as accounting criteria are suitable and useful bases for investors to select a portfolio. © 2015 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to devise a strategy for developing a flexible tool to efficiently install a marine energy farm in a suitable area. The current methodology is applied to marine tidal current, although it can be extended to other energy contexts with some adaptations. We introduce a three-step approach that searches for marine farm sites and technological solutions. The methodology applied is based on a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and an optimization algorithm. The integration of GIS and MCA is at the core of the search process for the best-suited marine areas, taking into account geographical constraints, such as human activity, pressure on the environment and technological opportunities. The optimization step of the approach evaluates the most appropriate technologies and farm configurations in order to maximize the quantity of energy produced while minimizing the cost of the farm. Three main criteria are applied to finally characterize a location for a marine energy farm: the global cost of the project, the quantity of energy produced and social acceptance. The social acceptance criterion is evaluated by the MCA method, Electre III, while the optimization of the energy cost is approximated by a genetic algorithm. The whole approach is illustrated by a case study applied to a maritime area in North-West France.. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={There is a lot of methods which are currently used for assessment of urban public transport system development and operation e.g. economic analysis, mostly Cost- Benefit Analysis - CBA, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis - CEA, hybrid methods, measurement methods (survey e.g. among passengers and measurement of traffic volume, vehicles capacity etc.), and multicriteria decision aiding methods (multicriteria analysis). The main aim of multicriteria analysis is the choice of the most desirable solution from among alternative variants according to different criteria which are difficult to compare against one another. There are several multicriteria methods for assessment of urban public transport system development and operation, e.g. AHP, ANP, Electre, Promethee, Oreste. The paper presents an application of one of the most popular variant ranking methods - Electre III method. The algorithm of Electre III method usage is presented in detail and then its application for assessment of variants of urban public transport system integration in Cracow is shown. The final ranking of eight variants of integration of urban public transport system in Cracow (from the best to the worst variant) was drawn up with the application of the Electre III method. For assessment purposes 10 criteria were adopted: economical, technical, environmental, and social; they form a consistent criteria family. The problem was analyzed with taking into account different points of view: city authorities, public transport operators, city units responsible for transport management, passengers and others users. Separate models of preferences for all stakeholders were created.},

abstract={The paper focuses on portfolio selection problems which aim at selecting a subset of alternatives considering not only the performance of the alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria, but also the performance of portfolio as a whole, on which balance over alternatives on specific attributes is required by the Decision Makers (DMs). We propose a two-level method to handle such decision situation. First, at the individual level, the alternatives are evaluated by the sorting model Electre Tri which assigns alternatives to predefined ordered categories by comparing alternatives to profiles separating the categories. The DMs' preferences on alternatives are expressed by some assignment examples they can provide, which reduces the DMs' cognitive efforts. Second, at the portfolio level, the DMs' preferences express requirements on the composition of portfolio and are modeled as constraints on category size. The method proceeds through the resolution of a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and selects a satisfactory portfolio as close as possible to the DMs' preference. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example which integrates a sorting model with assignment examples and constraints on the portfolio definition. The method can be used widely in portfolio selection situation where the decision should be made taking into account the performances of individual alternatives and portfolio simultaneously. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Artificial lift is defined as a system that adds energy to the wellbore fluid column with the objective of initiating and enhancing production from the well. Artificial lift is needed when reservoir drives do not sustain acceptable rates or cause fluids to flow at all in some cases. Lift processes transfer energy down hole or decrease fluid density in wellbore to reduce the hydrostatic load on formation. Artificial lift systems use a range of operating principles, including pumping and gas lifting.ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) model or method is one of the most prevalent Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. MCDM is an approach employed to solve problems involving selection from among a finite number of criteria. An MCDM method specifies how attribute information is to be processed in order to arrive at a choice.In this paper, a novel software method based on ELECTRE model as a mathematical optimizer has been presented for artificial lift systems selection in petroleum industry validated with several certain oil fields data (such as: the Iranian Salman, Nosrat and Kuh-E-Mond (MD-6) oil fields) that finally, a considerable accordance between ELECTRE model program final results and the fields operational results has been found. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP's) businesses developed at a high rate in the past few years due to the need for the return of products or used products to the producer. This was influenced by government restrictions concerning the environment protection, or due to the fact that recycling the used products is more profitable than the savings of not providing a reverse logistics chain. Ranking and Selecting the best third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP) represents a challenging task in our days because in most of the business areas there are many qualified reverse logistics provider available for the manufacturers to select as a partner. Most often, within the same business area different 3PRLP are having different specializations and skills and that makes the decision process very difficult for the manufacturer. This paper attempts to solve the third party logistics provider's selection problem through a multi criteria decision making approach - "Elimination et choice translating reality"(Electre II). The Electre method uses the concept of outranking relationship. The model is applied to a battery recycling case.},

abstract={Designers of light-frame wood wall assemblies should consider several performance criteria simultaneously in addition to minimum requirements set by building codes. Evaluation of various performance characteristics can help select the most suitable configuration for a given project in a given context. In a previous article, we identified appropriate criteria and explored their means of evaluation. Following up, this article integrates the context and the preference of the decision-maker and seeks to obtain a ranking of the various alternatives using quantitative and qualitative information. Four multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques are explored: weighted sum, MACBETH, ELECTRE II, and PROMETHEE. The approach is applied to a case study where five wall assemblies are compared within six different decision contexts. It shows how the choice of the appropriate aggregation method depends on the nature of the performance evaluation scales and demonstrates the usefulness of MCDA to consider simultaneously different aspects of wall performance. © 2010 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).},

abstract={This study presents a Decision Support System (DSS) which supports assignment of actions (e.g., numbers, projects, people etc.) into predefined categories according to their score on evaluation criteria. It implements a novel classification algorithm based on multicriteria analysis and fuzzy preference relations. More detailed, assignment to classes is based on the concept of category threshold, which defines at what degree an alternative can be included in a specific category. For each category a threshold is defined by the corresponding decision maker, which indicates its lower limit with respect to the evaluation criteria. Actions are then evaluated according to the criteria and fuzzy inclusion degrees are calculated for each category. Finally, an action is assigned to the category for which the inclusion degree is the maximum. The DSS implements the above classification algorithm, providing a user-friendly interface, which supports decision makers to formulate and solve similar problems. In addition to the DSS, we present a real world application at a classification problem within the environment of a Greek bank. Results derived from evaluation experiments in the business environment provide evidence that the proposed methodology and the DSS can effectively support decision makers in classification decisions. The methodology as well as the proposed DSS can be used to classification problems not only in financial domain but to a variety of domains such as production, environmental, or human resources. ©2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={When investing into real estate, especially into commercial buildings, it is very important to choose a right location. Location should be chosen in order to meet highest and best usage of the future commercial building. Usefulness and efficiency of location are determined by qualities which may be divided into the following groups: 1) common qualities; 2) special qualities characteristic to a particular activity. Great attention should be paid to city land use model. Development of Vilnius City has been based on several models and due to a great variety and instability of location criteria, selection of land site for commercial property becomes complicated. Real estate investments require creation of cardinal criteria system, which could facilitate the selection of location. Exhaustive information about location is of vital importance for investments into real estate. Therefore research of information systems related to geographical location, GIS, must be conducted. Using cardinal criteria system we would be able to match multicriteria decision-making methods suitable for solving discrete alternative problems. After having determined cardinal criteria, most suitable multicriteria decisionmaking methods are as follows: 1) linear reckoning/ascription method; 2) simple add weighting method (SAW); 3) hierarchical add weighting method; 4) ELECTRE method; 5) method of distance from ideal point (TOPSIS). From the practical point of view it is difficult to define ideal location as possibility to compensate by other criteria or attach to one the particular criterion, as every location is unique in its one way. ELECTRE method based on binary comparison of options in order to determine whether the criteria of option meet criteria's predomination or contradict it was chosen as one of the most suitable innovative selective methods for choosing the commercial property's location. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Growing energy demand and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are driving a significant hydropower (HP) generation expansion in the Alpine area. However, despite its advantages, HP implementation causes several impacts on the ecological status of river systems and the preservation of characteristic landscapes. The use of decision-making tools, like multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, can provide helpful support to achieve more sustainable solutions for complex water management problems. In Aosta Valley (NW Italy), an MCDM experimental approach is being applied to define the optimal environmental flow scenario to be released by HP plants, in an attempt to balance energy production needs, economic profitability and environmental safeguard. Four criteria are considered (energy, environment and fishing, landscape, economy) and key stakeholders are involved in the entire decision-making process. However, there is a need to test also other MCDM methodologies in order to understand if an alternative approach could be more suitable for future, more complex, HP management decisions. Therefore, in this paper, seven different MCDM methods are applied to an existing small run-of-the-river HP plant for the selection of the optimal flow release scenario, i.e., SAW, WPM, AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, ELECTRE III, and the initially adopted method, SHARE MCA. The results obtained with the application of the different MCDM methods are investigated and statistically compared. The strengths and weaknesses of the different methodological approaches are also discussed. Based on the comparative results and the consequent evaluations, SHARE MCA, WPM, and VIKOR appear to have the most interesting characteristics in terms of overall feasibility. © Copyright © 2021 Vassoney, Mammoliti Mochet, Desiderio, Negro, Pilloni and Comoglio.},

abstract={International trade in food knows no borders, hence the need for prevention systems to avoid the consumption of products that are harmful to health. This paper proposes the use of multicriteria risk prevention tools that consider the socioeconomic and institutional conditions of food exporters. We propose the use of three decision-making methods—Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE), and Cross-Efficiency (CE)—to establish a ranking of countries that export cereals to the European Union, based on structural criteria related to the detection of potential associated risks (notifications, food quality, corruption, environmental sustainability in agriculture, and logistics). In addition, the analysis examines whether the wealth and institutional capacity of supplier countries influence their position in the ranking. The research was carried out biannually over the period from 2012–2016, allowing an assessment to be made of the possible stability of the markets. The results reveal that suppliers’ rankings based exclusively on aspects related to food risk differ from importers’ actual choices determined by micro/macroeconomic features (price, production volume, and economic growth). The rankings obtained by the three proposed methods are not the same, but present certain similarities, with the ability to discern countries according to their level of food risk. The proposed methodology can be applied to support sourcing strategies. In the future, food safety considerations could have increased influence in importing decisions, which would involve further difficulties for low-income countries. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Skincare is currently growing very fast. The community, especially women, both teenagers and parents, now believes more in Skincare services and products that change consumers' faces to be cleaner, and shine for their appearance. However, until now there are still obstacles that are often faced by consumers in choosing Skincare that is in accordance with the needs of their skin type. This study aims to recommend the selection of Skincare products based on consumers using the ELECTRE method. The data collection method was carried out by means of interviews and questionnaires on 250 samples of consumers who use Skincare products in the city of Pematangsiantar. Based on these results the criteria for evaluating prices (X1), ingredient content (X2), side effects (X3), availability of goods (X4), and packaging (X5). The alternatives used are 4 namely: A1 = Gamier, A2 = Nature Republic, A3 = Pond's, A4 = Wardah. The results of the research using the ELECTRE method show that Skincare Garnier (A1) products are recommended to be the best Skincare based on consumers. It is expected that research results can provide understanding to consumers in choosing Skincare products. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, environmental awareness has increased considerably, and in order to decrease endangerments such as air and water pollution, and also global warming, green procurement should be employed. Therefore, in the assessment of suppliers, their environmental performance should be taken into consideration along with other criteria for supplier selection. Raising awareness of sustainability in production and conservation and protection of the environment is very important both for the whole environment and for the company itself by increasing its competitive advantage. And, one of the steps to achieve this is for the companies to try to select green suppliers. So, the purpose of this study is to raise awareness and tackle the need for green supplier selection and, using multiple-criteria decision-making models, to elaborate a case study regarding this. A survey was conducted in a manufacturing firm. The data were analysed, and fuzzy MCDM (multicriteria decision-making) methods and artificial neural networks were implemented. Fuzzy methods are the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP), fuzzy TOPSIS, and fuzzy ELECTRE. ANN supports the result of fuzzy MCDM models from the profit side. ANN can make the best estimate of the current year based on historical data. Fuzzy MCDM methods will also find good solutions using the available data but will produce different solutions as there are different decision-making methods. It is aimed to produce a synergy from the solutions obtained here and to produce a better solution. Instead of a single method, it would be more accurate to produce a better solution than the solution provided by all of them. The dominant result has been obtained using the committee fuzzy MCDM and ANN to select the best green supplier. © 2020 Tina Gegovska et al.},

abstract={The notion of fuzzy N-soft sets is a hybrid model, which is a more generalized framework than fuzzy soft sets. To investigate the objects of a reference set in medical field, which have uncertainties in data, can be correctly captured by proposed structures of novel decision-making methods, graded TOPSIS and graded ELECTRE-I methods, based on fuzzy N-soft sets (henceforth, (F, N)-soft sets). Both the proposed methods compute the decision-maker estimations in a more flexile and affluent way, as well as improve the reliability of the decisions, that depends on star ratings or grades for the purpose of the modelization of decision-making problems in medical field. We show the importance and feasibility of proposed methods by applying them on real life example in medical field having ambiguities, that can be accurately occupied by this framework. Finally, we discuss the comparison analysis of both the proposed decision-making methods. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The study aimed to explore the priorities of authorities and payers related to policy options for pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement and to understand the rationale of their preferences. Representatives of competent authorities for pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement and public payers of the 28 EU Member States were invited to express their preferences of 16 pharmaceutical policy measures in a web-based questionnaire. Replies of 27 respondents from 22 countries were analysed through a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, using an outranking method based on the ELECTRE III algorithm. Follow-up focus groups were held with 47 representatives of authorities and payers from 29 countries. Respondents to the online survey highly prioritized the policy objectives of equitable access to medicines and long-term sustainability of the health care system. They considered a transparent reimbursement process based on clear rules, pharmacoeconomic evaluations, generic substitution, value-based pricing and tendering as most appropriate policy options to achieve intended policy aims. Least preferred policy options were discounts and similar arrangements, differential pricing and external price referencing. However, the latter is a commonly used pricing policy, and discount arrangements have also been increasingly used. Participants of the focus groups highlighted limitations of external price referencing, including over-paying due to referencing to official prices instead of actually paid, confidential discounted prices. Given the lack of perceived alternatives policy-makers continue applying existing tools. At the same time, they are searching for new policy options that should be based on the principles of fairness, solidarity and transparency. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Central challenges are the diversity of properties to consider and the lack of high-quality experimental data. To address this, a novel alternatives assessment procedure was developed based on in silico data and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. As a case study, 16 alternatives to the flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether were considered. The hazard properties included persistence (P), bioaccumulation potential (B), toxicities (T), and mobility in water (M). Databases were consulted and 2866 experimental data points were collected for the target chemicals; however, these were mostly replicate data points for some hazard criteria for a subset of alternatives. Therefore, in silico data and three MCDA strategies were tested including heat mapping, multiattribute utility theory (MAUT), and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE III). The heat map clearly showed that none of the target chemicals are hazard-free, whereas MAUT and ELECTRE III agreed on ranking the "least worst" choices. This study identified several challenges and the complexity in the alternatives assessment processes motivating more case studies combining in silico and MCDA approaches. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Selection of a retail location is a strategic decision-making problem that involves the long-term commitment of resources. However, very often managers look for several candidate locations that can be incorporated in a business plan. In this article, a case study developed in a large Brazilian company is presented where managers required to identify a set of interesting locations in a context of imprecise and qualitative information. ELECTRE TRI-C is applied, a multi-criteria decision analysis sorting method in which representative reference alternatives are used to model preference ordered categories, a priori. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) are used as input in ELECTRE TRI-C, which allows: (1) imprecision and uncertainty parameters to be set in a very transparent way; (2) in the case of qualitative criteria, to define a category by providing information about reference alternatives in the form of the membership degree of verbal values, a feature that was not available so far in this method; (3) the outranking indices to be calculated such that the rationale of assignment rules is preserved; (4) the proliferation of fuzzy numbers to evaluate alternatives to be avoided, thus reducing the cognitive effort of the decision maker. TrFNs obtained in a previous analysis are used in the case study, thereby showing the advantages of the approach. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Decision Aid methods are used to find the best option from a set of alternatives when multiple and conflicting criteria have to be optimized simultaneously. The evaluation of the suitability or risk of each alternative is usually performed by assigning a numerical value. However, sometimes the data required to measure a criterion may be found in the form of semantic values such as tags. This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the strength of an outranking relation for a pair of alternatives using semantic criteria following the principles of ELECTRE-III (i.e. by means of concordance and discordance indices). The preferences about semantic data are represented in an ontology by means of objective and subjective functions. The paper explains how this new methodology was applied to analyse different electricity generation technologies using environmental and economic criteria. Two scenarios are tested to show how semantic criteria may influence the final decision. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, material selection is very important to improve the usage of a badminton racket. This study describes the use of the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) method in the material selection of a badminton racket frame with reference to the sustainable manufacturing practice of the frame. By categorizing the materials of the badminton racket frame according to mechanical, physical, chemical and environmental properties, and further detailed sub criteria were set according to the usage of these frames, the ELECTRE I method was used to determine the dominant material. Out of the six materials usually used in the manufacturing of a badminton racket frame, carbon fibre was the dominant material selected from three out of the four properties which are the mechanical, chemical and most importantly the environmental properties, as to comply with the sustainable manufacturing practice of these frames. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Rooftop distributed photovoltaic projects have been quickly proposed in China because of policy promotion. Before, the rooftops of the shopping mall had not been occupied, and it was urged to have a decision-making framework to select suitable shopping mall photovoltaic plans. However, a traditional multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method failed to solve this issue at the same time, due to the following three defects: the interactions problems between the criteria, the loss of evaluation information in the conversion process, and the compensation problems between diverse criteria. In this paper, an integrated MCDM framework was proposed to address these problems. First of all, the compositive evaluation index was constructed, and the application of decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method helped analyze the internal influence and connection behind each criterion. Then, the interval-valued neutrosophic set was utilized to express the imperfect knowledge of experts group and avoid the information loss. Next, an extended elimination et choice translation reality (ELECTRE) III method was applied, and it succeed in avoiding the compensation problem and obtaining the scientific result. The integrated method used maintained symmetry in the solar photovoltaic (PV) investment. Last but not least, a comparative analysis using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method and VIKOR method was carried out, and alternative plan X1 ranks first at the same. The outcome certified the correctness and rationality of the results obtained in this study. © 2018 by the authors.},

The university is currently using an aggregated score based on the performance of a student in the course. However, this method is facing difficulties in selecting the best students, because deficiencies in the way transferred, dropped and quit course credits are accounted for. As a possible alternative for the current method, we developed a hybrid ranking algorithm, called ELECTRE-TOPSIS (E-T). This method combines elements of the ELECTRE family and TOPSIS, two well-known multi-attribute analysis tools, to rank students based on objective criteria. Computational experiments and a case study were conducted to evaluate E-T. The results show that our approach provides quite competitive rankings in comparison with similar methods, through simultaneously eliminating ranking reversal and better balancing the formation time and the academic performance of the evaluated students. © Operational Research Society 2017.},

For this reason, this present study investigated the effects of existing coast characteristics and historical-cultural structure changes in recreation and tourism with respect to the Trabzon coastline in Turkey. Through literature and site survey, these effects were classified using specific coastal criteria which increase and decrease coastal use, and these were grouped by factor analysis. For the main criteria, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used, and for sub-criteria, the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) method was employed, combining multi-criteria decision-making methods to generate a priority ranking for all criteria. Consequently, "socialization", "city promotion" and "service quality" were revealed as the most effective criteria with respect to coastal use. The methods and the findings may significantly contribute to sustainable tourism planning for other urban coastal areas. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={In this paper, effects of the surface-catalysis efficiency on aeroheating characteristics are studied. The Navier-Stokes solver with a cell-centered finite-volume scheme, including the finite-rate chemistry and two-temperature thermal nonequilibrium models, is implemented in this work. The ELECTRE flight trajectory at 53 km is used for validating the developed solver. Several cases with different catalytic recombination coefficients are studied to investigate the effects of catalysis efficiency under the condition of radiative equilibrium for the C series of Radio Attenuation Measurement project II flight trajectory at 71 km. It is revealed that distributions of heat flux and wall temperature have the similar tendency for all cases except for the Stewart model. Heat flux and wall temperature do not grow endlessly as the catalytic recombination coefficients are increased. It is the gradient of species density rather than gradient of temperature that leads to the significant differences of heat flux and wall temperature for different cases. The results indicate that the zone influenced by catalysis efficiency for atomic oxygen is larger than the one for atomic nitrogen and that the recombination reactions of atomic oxygen are more active. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Marginalization studies of a population are tools that enable the Mexican government to understand and compare the socio-demographic situation of different regions of the country. The goal is to implement effectively various programs of social or economic development whose aims are to fight against the population's lag, which has affected the quality of life of Mexican citizens. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach for ranking the municipalities of the states of Mexico by their levels of marginalization is proposed, and the case of Jalisco, Mexico, is presented. The approach uses the ELECTRE III method to construct a mediumsized valued outranking relation and then employs a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) II to exploit the relation to obtain a recommendation. The results of this application can be useful for policymakers, planners, academics, investors, and business leaders. This study also contributes to an important, yet relatively new, body of application-based literature that investigates multi-criteria approaches to decision-making that use fuzzy theory and evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods. A comparison of the ranking obtained with the proposed methodology and the stratification created by the National Population Council of Mexico shows that the methodology presented is consistent and yields reliable results for this problem.},

abstract={Territorial decision problems have a spatial complex nature which is also multidimensional, interdisciplinary, poorly defined and requiring the definition of several criteria with dissimilar importance. These types of problem involve many decision makers (individuals and institutions), with conflicting interests, preferences and points of view. In the current study, our contribution focuses on the design and development of a multicriteria spatial group decision support system to conduct the spatial localization process in Territory Planning: the problem that involves finding a surface that best meets certain criteria from a set of variants (the location of infrastructure: shopping center, hospital, school, . . . ). The suggested system SIGMAS allows taking into account both the spatial dimension as well as specific and divergent interests of different decision makers to reach an acceptable agreement. In this context, the proposed SGDSS is based on the coupling of two representations of reality: Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).We endow the MAS with a negotiation protocol based on mediation, featuring a coordinator agent responsible for the smooth conduct of negotiation and a set of participant agents representing different decision makers impacted by the decision in TP. This protocol exploits, also, multicriteria analysis methods namely ELECTRE III and ELECTRE TRI. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Making decisions on a sound basis in early phases is one of the most difficult challenges in the product development process, especially when dealing with immature concepts. Moreover, life-cycle cost can be influenced up to 70% by decisions taken during the conceptual design phases. The need for reliable multi-criteria decision aiding methods is thus greater in these phases. Various multi-criteria decision aiding methods are proposed and used in the literature. The main criticism of these methods is that they usually produce contradictory results for the same problem. In this work, seven widely used multi-criteria decision aiding methods (weighed sum, weighted product, Kim and Lin, compromise programming, TOPSIS, quadratic mean and ELECTRE I) are analysed. This analysis was based on a real industrial case to develop a solar collector. The proposed multi-criteria decision aiding methods were compared in terms of three criteria deemed relevant in the relevant context: (1) adaptation of the type of results the multi-criteria decision aiding method is expected to bring, (2) correct handling of input information and (3) adaptation of the degree of compensation. Based on these criteria, it was proven that weighted product is the most appropriate multi-criteria decision aiding method in our case. In addition, it has been demonstrated that sensitivity analysis can improve the benefit of using the multi-criteria decision aiding method chosen when dealing with imprecise information due to immaturity of concepts. © SAGE Publications. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Traffic offloading in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks is a key process in cellular networks so a mobile device chooses one of the available femtocells. In the last few years, several network selection methods have been proposed based on multiple attribute decision making (MADM) techniques for traffic offloading in LTE. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is an MADM method that has been barely studied for network selection in cellular networks; ANP configures the decision making problem as a network of attributes in order to derive priority scales of individual judgments. We propose in this paper NetANPI (Network selection ANP-based mechanism with Ideal network comparison), which is an ANP decision making mechanism for traffic offloading in LTE. We show its effectiveness by contrasting it with MADM methods proposed in the literature as AHP, ELECTRE, TOPSIS, GRA, and SAW. We also introduce a mechanism to rank the MADM algorithm using utility theory. Our results show that NetANPI outperforms the most used MADM mechanism for the interactive and conversational traffic classes. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, uncontrolled exploitation of ground water has doubled water scarcity problem, while proper control and management of these resources can solve water shortage problem to some extent. One of the approaches for managing groundwater resources is artificial recharging of groundwater and determining the best location for this. This study aimed at ranking Shahroud-Bastam watershed using ELECTRE and linear assignment methods and the results of these two methods are compared. These two models are of multiple-criteria decision making compensation and coordinated subgroup models. The findings indicate that among the seven zones in ELECTRE method mentioned above, zones (3, 4,5) with four dominations and 2 defeats and 2 points are in the first ranking and are the most suitable zones for artificial recharge. Zone (1) with six defeats and no dominations and (-6) points is in the last ranking and is not suitable for artificial recharge of ground water. Zones (2, 6, 7) respectively with (2, 2, 1) dominations and (4, 4, 5) defeats and with (-2, -2, -4) points are in the next rankings respectively. Zones (1, 2, 6, 7) must be removed because the number of their defeats is more than the number of their dominations and have negative points. In linear assignment method, among 7 zones, zone 3 has the first rank and is the best zone for artificial recharge and zone 7 is in the last ranking and is not suitable for artificial recharge. Zones (4, 2, 5, 6, 1) are in the next rankings respectively. Between these two methods, the results of linear assignment method are more consistent with reality and are more accurate. © 2014, by the author(s).},

abstract={For half a century, the significant development of intensive farming has led to a massive use of products such as pesticides. The excessive use of these substances has contaminated surface water and groundwater. Some drinking water extraction points have also had to be abandoned. Around 30 years ago, in the southwest of France, a group of farmers decided to improve their farming methods, as well as developing new best environmental practices, such as grass strips along streams and riparian forests. By combining ELECTRE TRI-C, a sorting multi-criteria model, with a GIS, we were able to assign each farming parcel to one of the five levels of risk associated with surface water pesticide contamination. We also assessed the effectiveness of best environmental practices, and found that their use led to a reduction in the risk of pesticide transfer. This methodology re-enforces decision support tools for both water resource managers and agricultural and environmental stakeholders. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Main decisions problems can be described into choice, ranking or sorting of a set of alternatives. The classical ELECTRE TRI (ET) method is a multicriteria-based outranking sorting method which allows to assign alternatives into a set of predetermined categories. ET method deals with situations where indifference is not transitive and solutions can sometimes appear uncomparable. ET suffers from two main drawbacks: 1) it requires an arbitrary choice of λ-cut step to perform the outranking of alternatives versus profiles of categories, and 2) an arbitrary choice of attitude for final assignment of alternatives into the categories. ET finally gives a final binary (hard) assignment of alternatives into categories. In this paper we develop a soft version of ET method based on belief functions which circumvents the aforementioned drawbacks of ET and allows to obtain both a soft (probabilistic) assignment of alternatives into categories and an indicator of the consistency of the soft solution. This Soft-ET approach is applied on a concrete example to show how it works and to compare it with the classical ET method. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to structure a real world investment problem in the publishing sector as a multicriteria decision problem in order to support a large Greek publishing company in making its specific strategic decisions. As a first step of the proposed approach a set of twelve publishing products in the Greek market is identified. Afterwards the distinct set of incremental impacts as tangible results of these actions is determined by taking advantage of the system's competitiveness, effectiveness and flexibility. Then a consistent family of nine criteria reflecting the company strategy is structured. Finally, the paper outlines the implementation of the ELECTRE II multicriteria method which is adapted to true evaluation criteria so as to rank order the strategic actions and to provide an adequate and efficient decision support. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the Internet and electronic commerce has given rise to electronic supply chain management (e-SCM) which enhances communication, coordination, and collaboration between the trading partners. However, when confronted by the range of e-SCM frameworks, organisations struggle to identify the one most appropriate to their needs. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy group multi-criteria method for e-SCM framework evaluation and selection. The contribution of the proposed method is fourfold: (1) it addresses the gaps in theSCMliterature on the effective and efficient assessment of the e-SCM frameworks; (2) it is grounded in the excellence model introduced by the European Foundation for Quality Management; (3) it provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines real options analysis and the analytic hierarchy process with a group Electre method; and (4) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain, or imprecise information.We also present the results of a real-world case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and the algorithms. We show that the proposed framework can help a group of decision makers to think systematically by decomposing the alternative evaluation process into manageable steps and integrating the results to arrive at a solution consistent with managerial goals and objectives. The analysis of this case study allows for the articulation of a series of key factors that can be considered important in contributing to the successful implementation of the e-SCM framework. The first element is getting the key people on board. The second factor is building internal alliances. The third key ingredient is the persistent and systematic process put in place to evaluate the e-SCM success. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Each alternative for a repair contract implies a specific response time and related cost. The response time is associated with the commitment of repair time, based on the contract. A decision maker chooses the best alternative taking into account the system performance and the cost of the contract. This problem has been analysed through a multicriteria decision model. This decision model supports decision makers in the determination of the best combination of contracting conditions. The decision model proposed allows the decision maker to quantify the consequences of an action taking into account two basic criteria: the cost of the contract and the system performance. Two different decision models have been built to support decision makers. These decision models are based on different multicriteria approaches. The first, reported in a previous paper, is based on the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT). The model presented in this paper is based on the ELECTRE I method combined with utility functions. The paper presents the main theoretical aspects related to both approaches and practical implications related to model building. A numerical application is presented in order to illustrate the use of the decision model.},

abstract={Decision-making to determine the preferred way of upgrading or constructing new developments is becoming more complex. In the drive towards sustainability, the social, economic and environmental aspects now share equal weighting with the technical and cost-effective elements of each option. The process of evaluating trade-offs between, say, cost benefits and environmental or social disbenefits, has always been difficult, and it is now also important to demonstrate openness in decision-making, so that stakeholders can see the option selected is in fact the best possible within the constraints set. A simple multi-criteria approach, known as WISPS (wastewater integrated system performance score) has been applied in a theoretical study using actual data to decide which of four catchments in a Scottish water authority area should be prioritized for improvement. This approach follows closely the process which the engineers would use implicitly to make decisions, but has the benefit of formalizing the process, thus showing how these decisions were achieved. The robustness of the approach has been tested using two software packages: one for risk assessment (RISK) utilizing Monte Carlo simulation; and the other, a complex multi-criteria decision support tool (ELECTRE). The more complex analytical approaches demonstrated that the simple WISPS method produced reliable results.

abstract={This article develops a group decision support scheme that extends the widely accepted ELECTRE-II model to the Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) context. ELECTRE-II takes into consideration subjective human opinions, and establishes two types of embedded outranking relations which yield a complete preference ordering of actions. Its variants under different models have produced a considerable number of applications. Keeping in view the stronger capability of PF model to handle uncertain information, a group decision support algorithm, named as PF-ELECTRE-II is presented for opinions in the adaptable PF structure. A first phase aggregates the PF opinions of the experts on each alternative and criteria with the aid of suitable PF aggregation operators. Then, the algorithm introduces three types of PF outranking sets (concordance, indifferent and discordance sets), and establishes strong and weak outranking relations. The later are graphically represented by strong and weak outranking graphs, which are finally explored by a systematic iterative procedure that leads to the provision of a preferred system. We display these steps conducive to the PF-ELECTRE-II algorithm by a flow chart to facilitate its application. Finally, the decision results provided by this methodology in a supplier selection context are compared with those that available techniques put forward. A detailed comparative analysis is performed to establish the superiority of the proposed method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this study, an extension of a group Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method based on the fuzzy ELECTRE III (ELimination Et Choice Translating REality) model is presented for water supply choice optimization. The fuzzy ELECTRE III method is improved by using three credibility definitions - concordance, discordance, and net degrees. Experts' opinions are transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers based on the level of uncertainty associated with quantitative and qualitative criteria. The main priority of this method compared to other existing MCDM is that it is a more effective way of dealing with the uncertainties in projects as the application of the opinions is made based on a group decision. A Case Study of a water supply system for the Gamasiab Basin located in the Kermanshah province of Iran is examined to demonstrate the application of the model. Comparing the introduced method's results with the existing MCDMs, including fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy AHP methods, indicated that the new method stands more consistent with the local experts' opinions. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended as the optimal decision-making technique for similar applications of complex water supply engineering projects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As the European Union wants to lead the clean energy transition, it has proposed ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement. The target established for 2020 on energy efficiency of 20% will unlikely be achieved, and the goal for 2030 has increased to 32.5%. In order to guarantee the planned goals, governments need to strengthen their current governance frameworks. Nevertheless, so far, there has been a lack of literature that suggests a sound methodological approach for performing governance capacity evaluation. For this reason, this paper aims at building a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding model to assess the current governance capacities on energy efficiency of the 28 Member States of the European Union. Our study explores the accomplishments in terms of energy efficiency governance through the ELECTRE TRI-nC method. After gathering all data and running the model, each country was classified according to its current governance efforts on energy efficiency.

abstract={During the early design stages of product-service systems (PSS), particular attention must be given to sustainability considerations to ensure the achievement of a sustainable PSS. However, there is a lack of decision-making support within existing design methods to help designers generating PSS solutions with reduced sustainability impact from the early design stages. To fill this gap, this paper elaborates on a decision support method coupling multi-criteria analysis and sustainability assessment, and considering PSS peculiarities. The aim of the method is to select PSS scenarios with the highest sustainability potential. Sustainability is assessed from multiple perspectives involving both the PSS actors’ points of view and sustainability pillars. The selection of the PSS design scenarios is supported by a multi-criteria analysis enabled by the ELECTRE I method. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on a case study around a PSS-oriented water-saving sanitary equipment intended for healthcare facilities. This provided some evidences of the applicability and relevance of the proposed method, which contributes ultimately to fostering sustainability integration within PSS design. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Today energy demand in the world cannot be met based on the growing population of the countries. Exhaustible resources are not enough to supply this energy requirement. Furthermore, the pollution created by these sources is one of the most important issues for all living things. In this context, clean and sustainable energy alternatives need to be considered. In this study, a novel interval-valued neutrosophic (IVN) ELECTRE I method is conducted to select renewable energy alternative for a municipality. A new division operation and deneutrosophication method for interval-valued neutrosophic sets is proposed. A sensitivity analysis is also implemented to check the validity of the proposed method. The obtained results and the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the given decision in the application is robust. The results of the proposed method determine that the wind power plant is the best alternative and our proposed method's decisions are consistent and reliable through the results of comparative and sensitivity analyses. © 2020 Vilnius University.},

abstract={Analytical justification of decision options using decision support systems (DSS) significantly improves the quality of decisions. The use of the currently existing DSS, which usually includes one or two decision-making methods, does not always lead to the desired results, since each method is based on certain assumptions and is not universal. The noticeable effect is achieved when many decision-making methods are included in one DSS knowledge base. The systems that meet these requirements belong to the class of Expert Decision Support Systems (EDSS), which currently includes more than 50 decision-making methods. Expanding the EDSS knowledge base, made by including new methods in it, allows choosing the most suitable solution method for each decision-making task. Addition of the decision table model, which is the basis of the system knowledge base, allows developing EDSS without completely processing the system program code. The ELECTRE methods were adopted for expanding the EDSS knowledge base. The basis for the selection was their key feature, which consists in the fact that they do not use the alternative valuation convolution operation given in different scales according to individual criteria. The article shows the adapted algorithms of the ELECTRE family methods ready for inclusion in EDSS. The algorithm is proposed for obtaining a criterion matrix being based on alternatives that serve as input information for the ELECTRE methods in cases where there is no objective information to fill it. The results of the study can be used to develop EDSS, that open the way to analytically substantiate solutions using methods that were not previously used in the system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Misunderstanding of technology transfer and lack of a scientific viewpoint in this area are among the fundamental problems of some industries. A novel Delphi-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) decision-making method, which benefited from both qualitative and quantitative methods, is introduced on gray numbers to solve the selection problem of technology providers systematically. The technology provider evaluation criteria are developed according to a literature review and experts&#x2019; opinions. Next, the Delphi method is used to evaluate the criteria. Gray DEMATEL is used to investigate the cause and effect relationship between the selected criteria, based on which the criteria were ranked. Finally, using the gray ELECTRE method, the priority of companies is determined. Based on the results of the illustrative case study, the two most robust causal criteria are management&#x002F;executive capability and cost. Moreover, cost and support through organization policies played a leading role in the system. Also, out of nine technology providers, company 4 is superior to other companies, whereas most companies were of greater advantage to company 5. According to the comparison of weights by Spearman&#x0027;s correlation coefficients, the proposed method is as efficient as the available methods. This novel method can be used in uncertain conditions to select the most reliable company. IEEE},

abstract={Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding is a public health issue associated with harmful effects simultaneously on patients and ED staff. Despite increased policies and efforts to manage this issue, it continues to rise in many EDs all over the world. ED overcrowding is not caused only by the high number of incoming patients and resources shortage, the most affecting factor leading to such problem is the inpatient boarding. In fact, the patient has to wait too long for an available hospital bed. This paper suggests a new approach to improve the inpatient flow using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. The aim is to make a rational choice of the appropriate department in the ward to which the inpatient can be assigned even if the department related to its pathology is already crowded. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based Delphi is used to collect data. Then, the AHP method is used to determine the weights of criteria that have an impact on the assignment decision. Finally, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) II, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) II are applied separately to rank the possible inpatient departments in ward in decreasing order of suitability to patient's pathology. The provided approach is tested to the ED of Habib Bourguiba University hospital of Sfax, Tunisia where the aggregation of AHP-Delphi and TOPSIS is considered. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Small on-site sanitation systems are widely present in suburban and rural areas in many countries. As these systems often underperform and have an impact on receiving waters, understanding their overall sustainability is of interest for policy and decision-makers. However, the definition and estimation of indicators defining sustainability are challenging, as it is finding the methodological approach to combine qualitative and quantitative indicators into one comprehensive assessment. In this study, twelve indicators defined by environmental, economic, social, technical and health-related criteria were used to compare nine alternatives of on-site sanitation for single households. A non-compensatory method for multi-criteria decision analysis, ELECTRE III, was used for the assessment together with weights assigned to each indicator by a reference group. Several scenarios were developed to reflect different goals and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Overall, the graywater-blackwater separation system resulted as the most sustainable option and, in terms of polishing steps for phosphorus removal, chemical treatment was preferred over the phosphorus filter, both options being implemented together with sand filters. Assessing the robustness of the systems was a crucial step in the analysis given the high importance assigned to the aforementioned indicator by the stakeholders, thus the assessment method must be justified. The proposed multi-criteria approach contributes to aid the assessment of complex information needed in the selection of sustainable sanitation systems and in the provision of informed preferences. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={This paper attempts to develop an outranking method based on intuitionistic 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic information and apply it to multi-criteria group decision-making problems. The theory of intuitionistic 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic elements (I2FLEs) is useful for modeling impressions and quantifying the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments in a convenient manner. The family of ELECTRE methods is well known and widely used outranking method, but it has not been investigated within the intuitionistic 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic environment. ELECTRE uses the concept of an outranking relationship. Therefore, the directional Hausdorff distance, which uses I2FLEs, is proposed and the outranking relations are subsequently defined using this distance. Furthermore, using the proposed score and accuracy functions of I2FLEs, this paper also develops an outranking method based on intuitionistic fuzzy support function, intuitionistic fuzzy risk function, intuitionistic fuzzy credibility function, and the net outranking flow index similar to the PROMETHEE method. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the developed approaches. Finally, a comparative discussion of two decision-making methods is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the other. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

This paper intends to develop a framework for assessing the maturity and preparedness of consultant companies for implementing BIM. The framework has three main steps including finding barriers, weighting barriers and maturity assessment. Barriers were identified by literature surveying. To discover the priority and validation of the barriers, a questionnaire was developed and distributed among 104 consultant companies in Iran. The questionnaires were analyzed by some statistical tests. Results showed that the ability of education and the cost of rework are the two most important challenges in Iranian consultant companies. By applying ELECTRE I method and the results of questionnaire analysis, the framework would be able to answer this question, “Is this company ready enough to run BIM?” Finally, a real case study was reviewed and four companies were assessed by the proposed framework. © 2018, Shiraz University.},

abstract={With the increase in the number of smartphones, the use of mobile applications is growing dramatically in today's high-tech environment. With this high user demand, the quality of mobile applications is becoming a serious issue. With the perspective of quality enhancement, these applications must be smart enough so that they can handle any kind of issue automatically. Also, with the increasing complexity of these applications, they need to be more self-managed for better operability and interoperability. The self-management features allow handling issues such as error handling, optimization, resource utilization, configuration management etc. by its own. This will lead to the better functionality of mobile applications. The present research work proposes to incorporate autonomic capability as an attribute for assessing mobile applications. A multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELECTRE-TRI outranking method is used to evaluate the self-management aspect i.e. the autonomic capability of mobile applications to provide the quality estimation of mobile applications a better way. © 2019, IGI Global.},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid version of the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE based on VIKOR method, which was never considered before. The advantage and strengths of the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE based on VIKOR method as decision aid technique and IFS as an uncertain framework make the proposed method a suitable choice in solving practical problems. Finally, a numerical example for engineering manager choice is given to illustrate the application of proposed method. The paper also gives a special view of point to the research along IFSs: It can be viewed as a kind of factorial scalar theory in factor space, which helps the authors to complete the paper with clear ideas. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Natural hazards such as earthquakes take place around the world and when combined with humans create natural disasters. Earthquakes, a form of natural hazard, have, in recent years, caused damage and destruction in many rural areas due to the lack of sustainability in political, economic, social, physical and operational criteria. Thus, to overcome the damage caused by earthquakes in rural areas, an assessment of sustainability status seems necessary to plan and strengthen in relation to the status of sustainability indicators. Data collection was performed through field methods and questionnaires. To test the hypothesis, T statistical methods, correlation method and F-test were performed using SPSS software (V22.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The results of the study showed that villages were at a low and undesirable level for all aspects, except social index in terms of sustainability. Comparisons showed that there was a significant mean difference among villages in terms of sustainability. The multi-criteria decision-making analysis has been considered and applied to a ranking of villages in terms of sustainability against the hazard of earthquakes. Finally, in order to improve the sustainability indicators of villages, some strategies have been presented. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Next generation wireless networks will consist of different types of radio access technologies. Emerging diverse applications have attracted a lot of users. Therefore, having the best connectivity anytime anywhere has become an important issue. Users would like to have continuous high quality network connection even when they handover from one network type to the other. Each access technology has its own features and service quality. In this regard, when there is a handover, it is important to choose the most suitable network based on user needs. Different algorithms have been proposed for network selection. Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods are widely used due to their precision and low computational complexity. In this paper, usual normalization methods used in network selection and their drawbacks are presented and a new method, by taking user preferences and application needs into account, is proposed. Based on the proposed normalization method, a new decision process is suggested which is based on ELECTRE II algorithm. Our proposed method considers the dynamic nature of wireless networks and the uncertainty in the collected network performance metrics. Simulation results show that using the proposed handover decision process, the probability of ranking abnormality, which is a common drawback of MADM methods, is reduced significantly compared to other methods such as SAW, GRA and TOPSIS and the decision algorithm is more stable in terms of sensitivity to change in the amounts of decision criteria. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, by analyzing the related literature, the companies providing security services and, more importantly, the data provided by a group of experts, a novel set of 39 criteria is extracted which assists the Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) selection process. The set is further categorized into eight general classes. The validity and weights of these criteria are measured by a group of experts in Iran. Due to the large number and often conflicting criteria, and the qualitative nature of the evaluations of the service providers, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods (FMCDM) are adopted. In order to demonstrate the application of the proposed model, a numerical example is included, in which eight service providers are evaluated by four decision makers applying fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy VIKOR, fuzzy Group ELECTRE, and fuzzy SAW methods. Owing to the variations of the outputs of the applied MCDM methods, they are further analyzed by an aggregation method to propose a unique service provider. A comparison between the output of the aggregation method and the four applied Fuzzy MCDM methods is also made with the help of Euclidean, Hamming, Manhattan and Chebyshev distances. The comparison shows the minimum diversion between the outputs of the Fuzzy TOPSIS and the aggregation method, which indicates the appropriateness of the fuzzy TOPSIS method in this particular problem. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The real world case study of selecting trams in an open bid competition constitutes a background for a research project. The author proposes a universal methodology of solving the decision problem at stake. The proposed methodology has a hybrid character and combines the concepts and rules of two methodologies: MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION MAKING/AIDING and GROUP DECISION MAKING. The tram selection problem is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem and solved with the application of selected MCDM/A methods (ELECTRE, AHP). The dynamics of individual interactions between members of the groups of Decision Makers (DM-s) and stakeholders as well as between the considered groups (municipal authorities, operator and residents - passengers) are considered. Different approaches to modelling and aggregating the preferences of the DM and stakeholders are presented. The Ex-ante analysis (group interaction prior to computational experiments), focused on building a common preference model for all stakeholders before calculations is compared with the Ex-post analysis featured by a series of computational experiments performed according to different preference models and aggregating its results afterwards (group interaction after computational experiments). A series of computational experiments is carried out and the generated results are demonstrated. They are compared and thoroughly analysed. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Policy makers often deal with a wide range of alternative probable future states for the entity they work for – a country, for example. To strive for the most desirable state, the policy makers must evaluate and rank all probable future scenarios. To this end, ‘scenario methods’ gained recent popularity are increasingly being employed. Nevertheless, currently, decisions made based on insight gained from scenarios are not made in an integrated systematic process. Current variants of the method help study the role of any research concept individually; thus, they do not provide a complete picture of the research situation. A more suitable variant of the method for today's world should provide a holistic view of the research situation by modelling possible links among research concepts. This paper, introduces a stepwise methodology that can guide the building, developing, and ranking of possible future scenarios, having factored in the possible causal interrelations among research concepts. The method is enriched with a combination of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, a widely used soft computing method, and ELECTRE III, a popular method of Multi Attribute Decision Making. This paper also presents the results of the application of the proposed methodology for Iran's housing market, highlighting the advantages of the proposed methodology. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd},

abstract={Maintaining relationships with suppliers has become a critical strategic management issue to business. As a consequence, the tasks of evaluating and selecting suppliers are essential, given that companies delegate part of their business to partners. The main purpose of these tasks is to identify suppliers with the highest potential for meeting a buyer's needs consistently and at an acceptable overall performance. However these tasks are complex since they involve a variety of conflicting criteria, which makes the problem one that can be tackled by an multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach. Moreover, companies have suppliers whose features and performance are different and buyers need to decide at each level how they may best collaborate with each type of supplier. Many papers in the literature have addressed this situation involving supplier selection; nevertheless, most of them present methods to solve ranking and choice problems. The objective of this paper is to propose a model for the strategic management of suppliers which uses the ELECTRE TRI method to sort suppliers into classes of collaboration. Therefore, by using this model it is possible for companies to do so in order to define the most appropriate strategies to adopt for each category. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Various multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) procedures have been developed over the last few decades to help decision-making in complex and seemingly intractable decision tasks. A major criticism of various MCDM methods is that they may yield different results when applied to the same problem. A comparative study is proposed here to identify similarities and divergences between the most used MCDM methods. Compared approaches include: ELECTRE III, PROMETHEE I and II, TOPSIS, AHP and PEG. Two multi-criteria case studies are presented. Studied methods are employed to establish an arrangement of a number of alternatives based on two and eight conflicting criteria, respectively. A Gini index is used to quantify rankings dispersion of Pareto optima obtained through studied MCDM methods. Results highlight the sensitivity of the Pareto-compromise design and ranking to the applied MCDM method. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The choice of process modelling language can affect business process management (BPM) since each modelling language shows different features of a given process and may limit the ways in which a process can be described and analysed. However, choosing the appropriate modelling language for process modelling has become a difficult task because of the availability of a large number modelling languages and also due to the lack of guidelines on evaluating, and comparing languages so as to assist in selecting the most appropriate one. This paper proposes a framework for selecting a modelling language in accordance with the purposes of modelling. This framework is based on the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) for evaluating process modelling languages and a multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach in order to select the most appropriate language for BPM. This study does not attempt to set out new forms of assessment and evaluation criteria, but does attempt to demonstrate how two existing approaches can be combined so as to solve the problem of selection of modelling language. The framework is described in this paper and then demonstrated by means of an example. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using SEQUAL and MCDA in an integrated manner are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The ELECTRE method utilizes the concordance and discordance set. And then use concordance and discordance indices to construct concordance and discordance matrices. Both concordance and discordance indices have to be calculated for every pair of alternatives. Based on the aggregate matrix, a decision graph can be depicted to determine which alternative is preferable, incomparable or indifferent. It first uses concordance and discordance indices to analyze outranking relations among alternatives from real-world applications. In this paper, an extension of ELECTRE method, a multiple attributes hesitant fuzzy decision making technique, to a decision environment is investigated, where the individual decision value are provided by the hesitant fuzzy information. We first introduce some concepts of hesitant fuzzy set. Then, the hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE method is proposed in detail. Finally, an illustrative example for evaluating the performance of the industry zones is used to illustrate the developed methods. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={The agrifood sector is considered as one of the leading sectors in Europe, in terms of turnover, value added and employment. The economic and political impact of this sector is recognised and emanates by the large number of participating companies in this industry that need to develop more sustainable approaches to food production, supported by integrated and efficient production systems. However, all agricultural sectors are not equally harmful to the environment, thus different agrifood supply chains should be assessed and prioritised in order for policy measures to become more effective. This paper aims at the development of a multi-criteria analysis approach that focuses on the prioritisation of agrifood supply chains with the use of specific socio-economic, technological and environmental criteria. The approach follows the path of outranking multi-criteria methods, ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE. For the assessment of the agrifood supply chains, policy makers and experts' views are taken into account. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Services are ubiquitously delivered over multiple wireless access technologies in a heterogeneous wireless network environment. A significant issue is the ranking of the alternative access networks and the selection of the most efficient and suitable one in order to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of a specific service, as these are defined by the user. With this way, the user receives enhanced Quality of Experience. However, decisions on which network to connect are usually difficult to be reached, since multiple factors of different importance have to be taken into consideration. The subject of the paper is the introduction of a novel unified network selection framework. A framework for defining decision criteria weights relying on the variance of network measurements is also provided. For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process are deployed so as to unravel the patterns in data and retrieve parameter weights through pair wise comparisons respectively. The framework addresses the final network selection by the employment of Multi Attribute Decision Making methods and by using certain QoS indicators acting as figures of merit which influence the decision process. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested through extended simulations and a discussion over its performance is made. Some useful conclusions are drawn. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper attempts to present a method for differentiating between multi-attribute decision procedures and to identify some competent procedures for major decision problems, where a matrix of alternative-measure of effectiveness and a vector of weights for the latter are available. In this respect, several known multi-attribute analysis procedures are chosen, and the same procedures are exploited to evaluate themselves, based on some evaluation criteria. This is done from an engineering viewpoint and in the context of a transportation problem, using a real case light rail transit network choice problem for the City of Mashhad, and the results are presented. Two concepts have been proposed in this respect and used in this evaluation; peer evaluation and information evaluation, which are investigated in this paper. In the evaluation of five multi-attribute decision procedures, based on nine criteria, and with the help of these procedures themselves in the context of the case under study, the results revealed that these procedures found Electre, Linear Assignment, Simple Additive Weighting, TOPSIS, and Minkowski Distance better than others, in the same order as given. This is backed by a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, despite specific conclusions made regarding the better decision procedures among those evaluated, this paper finds its contribution mainly in the approach to such evaluations and choices. © 2013 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={In manufacturing industries, various problems may occur during the production process. The problems are complex and involve the relevant context of working environments. A problem-solving process is often initiated to create a solution and achieve a desired status. In this process, determining how to obtain a solution from the various candidate solutions is an important issue. In such uncertain working environments, context information can provide rich clues for problem-solving decision making. This work uses a selection approach to determine an optimized problem-solving process which will assist workers in choosing reasonable solutions. A context-based utility model explores the problem context information to obtain candidate solution actual utility values; a multi-criteria decision analysis uses the actual utility values to determine the optimal selection order for candidate solutions. The selection order is presented to the worker as an adaptive knowledge recommendation. The worker chooses a reasonable problem-solving solution based on the selection order. This paper uses a high-tech company's knowledge base log as a source of analysis data. The experimental results show that the chosen approach to an optimized problem-solving solution selection is effective. The contribution of this research is a method which is easy to implement in a problem-solving decision support system.},

abstract={Since its conception ELECTRE TRI has been widely used to deal with several problems in the problematic of sorting. However, the inherent limitation of this method lies in its working with only one decision-maker. Currently there is an ELECTRE TRI version that can be used with multiple decision-makers, but it lacks the tools to deal with non-cooperative situations. Thus, this paper puts forward a negotiation procedure to be applied when using ELECTRE TRI. The procedure was inspired by the last-diminisher procedure and a version of the Nash Demand Game, Divide-the-Dollar, in order to establish an envy-free Nash Equilibrium and to control greed. The method establishes a negotiation process between decision-makers, in order to define each player’s degree of participation in determining the values of the ELECTRE TRI criteria, weights and parameters. Each parameter is divided into negotiable shares that will be distributed by means of the negotiation procedure, which represents the degree of participation of the decision-maker’s preferences. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Environmental planning aims to safeguard and foster the ecological functionality of agricultural landscapes. In order to reach a sustainable development of agricultural landscapes, in addition to ecological objectives socio-economic ones also need to be considered. In this context, the authors draw attention to three points. First, whenever ecologically sensitive areas ("ecological sites") are used for agricultural production, it is necessary to take account of the fact that farmers tend to adapt to environmental requirements by production responses outside the ecological site itself. Second, in order to identify the socially most "desirable" land-use responses it is necessary to supplement the above-mentioned environmental objectives by socio-economic ones. Third, when choosing an appropriate model for such multi-criteria decision analysis, the question of substitutability between criteria is of utmost importance. The paper discusses the above-mentioned issues against the background of a case study of environmental planning for an ecologically very valuable agricultural landscape in Germany, the Bayerisches Donauried. Two models of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) are applied, one based on the "single synthesizing criterion" method, and the other one based on the "synthesis by outranking" method. The models serve to evaluate four different land-use options, using criteria mainly derived from landscape functions and weights gained from interviews with major stakeholders. The paper presents the models' results concerning the ranking of the different land-use options and discusses the implications for agri-environmental policies and rural development planning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Regulation of pesticides in agricultural sector is becoming increasingly oriented to the use of best management practices in order to counter the effect of agricultural practices on health and groundwater. Several distinct criteria (economic, technical, environmental, social and informational criteria) need to be considered in the decision-making process. Moreover, the preferences of actors can vary according to the different management strategies and vested interests. In considering this context, a regional survey has been conducted in order to collect information on IPM opportunity. IPM is a pesticides management system which helps to solve pest problems while reducing environmental damage and increasing productivity. In conjunction with this regional survey, a multicriteria approach has been applied in order to help the decision-making process. ELECTRE-tri has been used and IPM opportunity evaluated from the results of the national survey and a critical review. Above all, key factors and impediments concerning the implementation of IPM have been identified. copyright © 2009 inderscience enterprises ltd.},

abstract={Infiltration systems are frequently used as an option to manage urban storm drainage. By reducing flows and volumes in downstream sewers or in surface waters, they decrease the overflows and make it possible to recharge groundwater. They come in vanous forms with different uses; therefore their performance is diverse and integrates multiple aspects. Consequently, a multicriteria approach was developed in order to quantify the performance of these systems and to help in decision making problems. For that purpose, a list of performance indicators integrating technical, economical, environmental and social aspects was developed. The performances were defined with the help of a working group composed of engineers from different technical or strategic departments from Greater Lyon and researchers from different fields. The paper presents the last version of the performance indicators tested according to a set of quality requirements: availability of data, relevance, fidelity, precision, sensitivity/robustness. This critical review of the set of indicators has led us to redefine a certain number of indicators, identify numerous biases and allow putting forward general instructions for criterion or indicator construction. The last phase is to propose multicriteria decision aid methods; a procedure using ELECTRE methods should be used. © IWA Publishing 2007.},

abstract={The fast ever-growing number of newly introduced mobile technologies makes the development of mobile information systems a somewhat complex activity. Decision makers - providers, merchants, and consumers alike - have to face great uncertainty and complexity regarding the acceptance of mobile technologies. Therefore, we stress that the selection process of an enabling technology for mobile commerce should be preceded with the use of a structured assessment methodology. With different available alternatives and various criteria for technology evaluation, multi-criteria decision making methods seem to be appropriate to support this selection process. Moreover, the success of introducing a new technology in a mobile information system depends on the preferences of varied involved actors in the market. We also consider in our approach the existence of multiple actors for the search of a technological consensus. As an illustration, we apply our approach to the mobile payment industry. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Solving multicriteria decision problems, like choice and ranking, requires the use of decision maker's DM's (Decision Maker's) preference model. In this paper, we investigate some issues of equivalence between the preference model in terms of "if..., then..." decision rules and a concordance-discordance preference model based on the use of the outranking relation. The decision rule model is attractive for at least two reasons: (i) it is intelligible and speaks the language of the DM. (ii) the preference information coming from the DM is a set of decision examples. The decision rules are induced from rough approximations of the preference relation specified in decision examples. Then, from the set of decision rules representing the DM's preferences, criteria weights and veto thresholds are inferred, setting up an equivalent preference model following from concordance-discordance tests proposed in ELECTRE methods. A simple example will illustrate the interest of such an equivalence.},

abstract={Many researchers are right considering economic effect of investments as the key indicator, however, ranking other social, ecological and technical indicators of efficiency separately and leaving them outside of investment ranking criteria system. The authors suggest using together all known efficiency criteria plus some specific of rural property: Payback period, Net present value, Internal rate of return, Profitability index, Business perspective, Rural property purchase price, Rural property reconstruction price, Number of workspace, Taxes, Social level of villagers, Fascination of village. Ranking rural property investment project does not mean deciding which criterion is preferred to another one. Therefore in this situation we use ELECTRE IV approach, because it's objective is to rank the options, but without any weighting criteria. The authors have made some alternatives of rural property revival: Heating and airing systems factory, Fish products manufacture, Woodworker manufacture. On the basis of calculation results the following partial ranking of the alternative projects is suggested: 1. Fish products manufacture; 2. Heating and airing systems factory; 3. Rural property; 4. Woodworker manufacture; 5. Sport and leisure centre. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Selection and assessment of mining equipment used in open pit rock mines relies chiefly on estimates of overall exploitation cost. The rational arrangement of mining equipment and systems comprising loading machines, haul trucks and crushing plants should be preceded by a thorough analysis of technical and economic aspects, such as investment outlays and the costs of further exploitation, which largely determine the costs of mining operations and the deposit value. Additionally, the operational parameters of the mining equipment ought to be considered. In this study, a universal set of evaluation criteria has been developed, and an evaluation method has been applied for the selection of surface mining equipment and the processing system to be operated in specific mining conditions, defined by the user. The objective of this study is to develop and apply the new methodology of multi-criteria selection of open pit rock mining equipment based on multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) procedures, to enable the optimization of loading, handling and crushing processes. The methodology, underpinned by the principles of MCDM, provides the dedicated ranking procedures, including the ELECTRE III. The applied methodology allows the alternative options (variants) to be ranked accordingly. Ultimately, a more universal methodology is developed, applicable in other surface mines where geological and mining conditions are similar. It may prove particularly useful in selection and performance assessment of mining equipment and process line configurations in mining of low-quality rock deposits. Therefore, we undertook to develop universal criteria and applications for the selection and performance assessment of process machines for surface mines, taking into account environmental aspects as well as deposit quality. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Conceptual design decisions form part of a multi-objective evaluation process that plays a critical role in product development. However, when there is interaction among the evaluation objectives, existing decision methods are difficult to determine the influence degree of each objective on the overall design desirability, which can lead to an unreliable decision regarding the most optimal scheme. In addition, it is difficult to deal with the vague judgments for qualitative objectives in decision-making under subjective decision environment. To maximize the overall design desirability of the scheme, An integrated product conceptual scheme decision approach based on Shapley value method and fuzzy logic model is proposed to transform the multi-objective conflict into a game problem of multi-objective trade-offs. The model is divided into two parts. First part is to use the evidence-based trust function and fuzzy logic model to integrate the group of detailed or imprecise evaluation data; this improves the reliability of the empirical data. Second, by aiming to maximize the overall design interest, SHVM in the coalitional game solves the optimal expectation for each objective and decides the optimal scheme. Finally, a shearer rocker height-adjusting device case study is presented to illustrate the applications, and a conceptual scheme trade-off decision prototype system is developed based on the approach for verification. This model is proven to be effective compared with the TOPSIS, VIKOR, and ELECTRE I. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multicriteria sorting methods are often used in decision aiding contexts where the objective is to assign alternatives to predefined ordered categories. The Electre Tri family of sorting methods is based on pairwise comparisons of the alternatives with some, possibly fictional, alternatives that are either upper or lower limits of the categories (Electre Tri-B), or one or more typical reference alternatives, that is, representative categories profiles (Electre Tri-C, Tri-nC). In this paper, we are interested in the Electre Tri-nC method and in indirect preference elicitation based on partial information provided by the Decision Maker. We therefore propose, apply and evaluate a preference disaggregation method for learning criteria weights and the credibility threshold used in Electre Tri-nC. The proposed disaggregation method is validated in an experiment using a climate classification problem for light tourism where 62,482 touristic locations are sorted into four categories. A robustness analysis of the method's performance using 150 learning sets is conducted and the results are presented and discussed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={The assessment of an investment is currently carried out by using mainly financial tools. This work presents a new model for the assessment of the sustainability of an industrial investment and focuses on the development of a holistic framework with the use of indicators. With the use of multi-criteria decision analysis, the framework evaluates a total of eighteen (18) alternative indicators in order to select the optimal bundle to be used for the assessment of future industrial investments. The proposed indicators are selected based on relevant data from the literature, taking into account the principles of prevention, planning and designing. The alternatives are assessed over four (4) criteria, namely environment, society, economy and technology, which are grounded on the principles of sustainable development. Depending on the special characteristics of the programme that is foreseen to fund the potential investments, the decision-maker is provided with a hierarchized set of indicators over which the alternative investments could be optimally assessed in parallel with widely used indicators that strictly assess economic performance. In the present work, twelve (12) different scenarios are examined, incorporating different values in the coefficients of the criteria. For the majority of the scenarios examined (a sensitivity analysis is also provided), the alternative indicator that is assessed with the highest score is "Resource Savings", followed by "Recycling" and "Research, Innovation, Development". © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for the discovery of knowledge in emergency response databases based on police incident reports, generating information that identifies local criminal demands that allow the selection of the appropriate policing strategies portfolio to solve the problem. Design/methodology/approach: The developed model uses a methodology for the discovery of knowledge involving text mining techniques using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) integrated with the ELECTRE I multicriteria method. Findings: The developed method allowed the identification of the most common criminal demands that occurred from January 1 to December 31, 2016, in the policing areas studied. One of the crimes does not occur homogeneously in a particular locality. In this study, it was initially observed that 40 per cent of the crimes identified in the Integrated Public Safety Area 5, or AISP-5, (historical city center of RJ) had no correlation with AISP-19 (Copacabana - RJ), and 33 per cent of crimes crimes in AISP-19 were not identified in AISP-5. This finding guided the second part of the method that sought to identify which portfolio of policing strategies would be most appropriate for the identified demands. In this sense, using the ELECTRE I method, eight different scenarios were constructed where it can be identified that for each specific criminal demand set there is a set of policing strategies to be applied. Research limitations/implications: The collected data represent the social dynamics of neighbourhoods in the central and southern zones of the city of Rio de Janeiro during the specific period from January 2013 to December 2016. This limitation implies that the results cannot be generalised to areas with different characteristics. Practical implications: The developed methodology contributes in a complementary way to the identification of criminal practices and their characteristics based on reports of police occurrences stored in emergency response databases. The knowledge generated through the identification of criminal demands allows law enforcement decision makers to evaluate and choose among the available policing strategies, which best suit the reality they study, and produce the reduction of criminal indices. Social implications: It is possible to infer that by choosing appropriate strategies to combat local crime, the proposed model will increase the population’s sense of safety through an effective reduction in crime. Originality/value: The originality of the study lies in the integration of text mining techniques, LDA and the ELECTRE I method for detecting crime in a given location based on crime reports stored in emergency response databases, enabling identification and choice, from customized policing strategies to particular criminal demands. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The inadequate reuse and recycle of construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW) has been identified as a major issue, as it implies the depletion of natural aggregates, massive occupation of landfill and inefficiency of construction industry. However, a holistic view involving economic, technical and comprehensive dimensions has rarely been adopted for C&amp;DW utilization evaluation against both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In this study, we propose a framework in a heterogeneous group decision-making environment to solve the C&amp;DW utilization mode selection problem by integrating the Choquet integral and the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method with two data forms, that is, interval-valued hesitant fuzzy numbers and real numbers. Firstly, an evaluation index system is constructed to assess multiple representative C&amp;DW utilization modes in Xi’an, China. Secondly, a novel method is proposed to apply the Choquet integral for aggregation of evaluation values and fuzzy ELECTRE for outranking of C&amp;DW utilization modes after the heterogenous evaluation data are unified into interval numbers. Thirdly, to illustrate the application of the proposed framework, this paper evaluates four typical C&amp;DW utilization modes based on a case study in Xi’an, China, and the result shows that the most preferable mode is A3 (off-site crushing, roadbed backfilling). Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted to verify the effectiveness of this framework. This study presents useful findings to C&amp;DW practitioners and can help avoid intuitive selection among available C&amp;DW utilization modes. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Global average temperature increases and causes extreme weather events, killing millions of people and affecting economic stability. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the primary factors that contribute to climate change that is the main concern of various municipalities in the world. In this paper, a two-step systematic approach is proposed to analyze municipal solid waste collection (MSWC) in Sfax, the second most populated city in Tunisia. In the first step, three feasible waste collection scenarios were suggested and have gained the consensus of decision makers and stakeholders. In the second, a geographic information system–based multi-criteria decision aid approach is proposed to identify the most appropriate scenario. Firstly, the Network Analyst function in ArcGIS is used to determine the optimal routes with the traveling distances and operational time of vehicles associated to each scenario. Secondly, a ranking of scenarios is produced by ELECTRE III method. Six pseudo criteria such as fuel consumption cost, gas emission, reliability, road length, and compatibility with the national energy policy were taken into account. The results suggest a relatively efficient and environment-friendly scenario where all vehicles start their trips from the depot, collect garbage from the gather sites, and unload waste at a transfer station then travel back to the depot. The methodology can be adopted into similar contexts to improve the effectiveness of MSW collection through the systematic use of GIS. © 2019, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).},

abstract={In present-day society, government public service outsourcing has become an irreversible trend due to the gradually increasing public pursuit of service quality and efficiency. To better meet the needs of the public and effectively improve the quality of service, it has been a crucial issue for government departments to choose the most desirable one from a series of public service outsourcers (PSOs) with distinct characteristics. In this paper, to deal with such decision problems, we propose the improved elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) II method with unknown weight information under the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic (DHHFL) environment to accurately and effectively select the best PSO. Firstly, aiming at the shortcomings of the original comparison method for double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (DHHFLEs), we define the hesitant deviation degree (HDD) for DHHFLEs and, based on this, further propose a new comparison method for comparing DHHFLEs more reasonably. Secondly, inspired by the classical power average (PA) operator proposed by Yager, a new method is introduced to determine the weights of experts with respect to each attribute, based on the support degree between attributes. Afterwards, an improved ELECTRE II method is proposed to address the problem of PSO selection. A numerical case about e-government outsourcer selection is given to demonstrate the enforceability of the method. Finally, comparisons between previous methods and our method are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and strengths of the proposed method. ©2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The multi-satellite image acquisition scheduling problem is traditionally seen as a complex optimization problem containing a generic objective function that represents the priority structure of the satellite operator. However, the majority of literature neglect the collective and contemporary effect of factors associated with the operational goal in the objective function, i.e., uncertainty in cloud cover, customer priority, image quality criteria, etc. Consequently, the focus of the article is to integrate a real-time scoring approach of imaging attempts that considers these aspects. This is accomplished in a multi-satellite planning environment, through the utilization of the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE-III) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and the formulation of a binary linear programming model. The two scoring approaches belong to different model classes of MCDM, respectively an outranking approach and a distance to ideal point approach, and they are compared with a naive approach. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the models and illustrate the importance of criteria neglected in previous studies. The results demonstrate the customized behaviour allowed by MCDM methods, especially the ELECTRE-III approach. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Due to the climate change and global warming, water shortage is known as a serious worldwide issue particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Utilization of subsurface dams (SSD) could be a solution to this matter, but finding a suitable site for construction of a SSD is an engineering challenge. Selection of the optimum location is carried out by evaluating different positive and negative criteria. Criteria are combined by means of multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM), such as AHP, ANP, TOPSIS and other well-known methods. In these research, because of the complexity of the decision and this fact that the results in other MCDM methods are very similar to each other, we choose ELECTRE method which is performed for site selection of SSDs. 10 regions out of 50 are studied as SSD alternatives in Isfahan province of Iran. For performing ELECTRE method, 14 criteria have been defined based on four different aspects of SSD construction that are hydrogeology, socio-economy, geology and climate change. The most important criteria include average annual rainfall, area of upper basin, distance from villages and stream slope. The modified ELECTRE III method was used to rank the alternatives from the most suitable choice for constructing a subsurface dam to the least. Hoseinabad area was finally selected to construct the sub-surface dam. Application of an advanced MCDM method like ELECTRE reduces some uncertainties in SSD site selection and this developed methodology can be used as a base for more detailed field investigations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The construction of Green Mine has become an essential policy for the management of mineral resources in China. This study aims to propose a favorable approach to assess the performance of Green Mine. The evaluation criteria are recognized based on the specific characteristics of Green Mine. Considering that some of these criteria could not be mutually compensated, a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is presented. It integrates the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) method with the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method in a picture fuzzy environment. In most existent methods, the evaluation information of Green Mine is described by real numbers. However, in this study, picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs) are first used to express such information to effectively indicate the uncertainty and fuzziness in the evaluation process. Another innovation is that the entropy weights model and the best-worst method (BWM) are combined to determine the comprehensive criteria weights. The practicability and advantages of the proposed method are verified by a case study and a comparative analysis with other methods. In addition, the influences of some parameters are discussed using sensitivity analysis to judge the flexibility and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible for solving the non-compensatory problems of evaluation criteria and can provide references for the performance evaluation and management of Green Mine. © 2013 IEEE.},

As each kind of MADM approach has its own strong and weak points, it is quite difficult to ensure which MADM algorithm is more appropriate for network selection. Moreover, from decision making perspective, an algorithm that can provide minor improvement in network selection accuracy is more preferable, rather than applying classical approaches prevailing from decades. In this context, this paper makes an attempt to identify the most suitable MADM method among the established outranking PROMETHEE and ELECTRE algorithms. The algorithms are tested in a heterogeneous environment with four overlapping networks and their performance is compared in terms of Network Selection Accuracy and Network Congestion. PROMETHEE algorithm produced beneficial results when compared to ELECTRE. © 2018 IEEE.},

The main result was a new and robust classification tool of timber species from the Congo Basin, corresponding to their multicriteria consensus degree. The potentials of the new grouping system were analysed. Species that meet a great majority of criteria were identified. They were highly suitable for sustaining the market position of glulam products.

abstract={In this study, the decision-making process for seawater desalination and its possible use in industry are addressed. Six desalination technologies were considered: multistage instantaneous distillation, multiple effect distillation, vapor compression distillation, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and nanofiltration. The problem was analyzed from several perspectives, including the evaluation of environmental, technical, and economic criteria, which were broken down into eight sub-criteria. The alternatives were evaluated considering three different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies: AHP, ELECTRE, and TOPSIS. The results show that the best option for desalinating seawater is reverse osmosis, followed by nanofiltration, thermal desalination methods, and lastly, electrodialysis. The results for the different methods showed the same ranking and no major discrepancies. It is concluded that desalination using membranes is a good option that could be used to supply water for various purposes, such as in industry. © 2018 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

abstract={Exponential growth in the amount of mobile applications for Mathematics has led users to confusion and difficulty in selecting proper application manually which suits to their needs. Therefore, there exists an imperative need for automated and efficient selection of mobile applications for Mathematics where users still heavily trust either application store ratings or the content rated by the application developer. In this study, fuzzy scale weights together with ELECTRE I (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) were used to solve a typical multi-criteria decision making problem on ranking selected mobile applications for Mathematics with respect to given set of criteria. The alternatives are mobile applications for Mathematics and were chosen from Google Play Store through considering top five highest user ratings and high usage frequencies. Ten sets of criteria on technical and pedagogical aspects specific to mobile applications and five alternatives were used in the ranking process. Findings suggest that ELECTRE I with fuzzy scale weights are remarkably practical for outranking and selection processes. Particularly in the case of unclear and imprecise ratings, this method could offer substantial solution. © 2018, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

In this way, it is necessary to monitor the performance of the contractors who already working with the organization to control failures during the development of work. Due the complexity and necessity of considering various criteria in the decision making; it is a multicriteria problem. Additionally, contractor evaluation method should classify them according to performance levels to help the client to decide whether to hire the contractor for future projects. In this context, the model proposed uses ELECTRE TRI method to classify the construction contractors according to their performance. Subsequently, a literature review was made to identify the most used criteria to assess contractors in the construction industry. Then, these criteria were used in a numerical simulation of the proposed model. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine priority order of Indian energy sector projects on investments and strategic dimension angles. Grey System Theory (GST) and COmplex PRroportional ASsessment (COPRAS-G) method, a flexible multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analyses, is used for this purpose to prioritize Indian energy sector projects, namely, coal, gas, hydro, solar and nuclear. Design/methodology/approach: The GST-based MCDM approach of COPRAS is used. Five projects of energy sector are compared based on various grey criteria. These criteria were selected on the perspectives of life-cycle costing and management-thinking approach for prioritizing these projects. The GST-based COPRAS-G is described, and results are discussed to draw a strategic road map for measuring the sustainability in the energy sector. Findings: On applying COPRAS-G on five energy projects, solar projects get high-priority order, and realistic scenario of results shows that renewable energy projects are preferred over the conventional projects such as coal and gas. Research limitations/implications: Here, COPRAS-G method is used as MCDM techniques. However, few other MCDM techniques such as fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evolution, elimination and choice expressing reality and efficiency analysis technique with output satisficing can be also explored to outrank various Indian energy sector projects. Practical implications: Indian energy sector involves high degree of complexity, and, therefore, it needs more flexibility to overcome the present barriers of effective decision-making. Grey decision theory-based method like COPRAS-G is able to address energy security dimensions on different scenario of energy supply, i.e. pessimistic, optimistic and realistic, precisely. Social implications: The results can provide guidance to the government or public sector regarding various possible investment options for energy supply and can help in drawing a rough trajectory of strategy toward energy security of the country. Originality/value: This paper can supplement and act as the support for decision-making in conflicting situations specifically to have outlook of the sub-sector project on different flexible scenarios. Moreover, such work can synergize conflicting ideas of decision makers and various stakeholders of the Indian energy sector. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The aim of our study is to promote the potential of the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) method in the field of economics of education. To evaluate the secondary education profiles in Serbia, we have used PISA data and the ELECTRE multi-level outranking (ELECTRE MLO) approach, as an alternative to commonly used econometric models. We introduce a new outranking relation, which is important for decision makers for two reasons. First, it allows the establishment of an acyclic relation, for which we provide a threshold value, that assures there will be no cycles in the relation graph. Second, the procedure does not require an excessive number of parameters as in other existing ranking methods, which enables an easier understanding, simplified use and less bias in the decision making process. After neutralizing the impact of socio-economic status and regional disparities, we obtain the performance levels for secondary education profiles in Serbia. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Objective Policy objectives, such as cost-containment and reward for innovation, can be conflicting, and different stakeholders are likely to prioritise policy measures with regard to their objectives differently. The study elicits preferences of different stakeholders in European countries about policy objectives and pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement measures in accordance with their preferred objectives. Methods Representatives of eight stakeholder groups (patients, consumers, competent authorities for pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, public payers, research-oriented industry, generic medicines industry, pharmacists, doctors) from the 28 EU Member States were invited to express their preferences about seven policy objectives and 16 measures in a web-based questionnaire. The replies were analysed through a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), using an outranking method based on the ELECTRE III algorithm. Results Based on 81 valid responses showed that nearly all stakeholders attributed highest priority to equitable access to medicines. Overall, stakeholders considered pharmaco-economic evaluation as the most appropriate policy measure to achieve policy objectives in accordance with their preferences. Value-based pricing and a transparent reimbursement process were ranked second and third. Across all groups, low preference was given to external price referencing (EPR) and co-payments, whereas stakeholders had differences in assessment on tendering, generic substitution and differential pricing. Conclusions The overall negative assessment of the commonly used EPR policy suggests a possible need for change in current pricing practice. However, positions about alternative pricing options differ considerably across stakeholders. It is recommended to further explore the motivation of the stakeholders for their assessments in a qualitative research project. © 2016 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine},

abstract={ELECTRE-III is a well-known multi-criteria decision analysis method that ranks a set of alternatives in terms of a set of heterogeneous evaluation criteria. It is based on constructing and exploiting a pairwise outranking relation between alternatives, which are defined with numerical and ordinal values. However, nowadays it is very common the use of descriptive linguistic tags, which is information that requires a qualitative treatment rather than a numerical one. In this paper we propose to store the user preferences about a set of tags in an ontological structure and to use this knowledge to construct the outranking relation by means of a semantic analysis of the tags associated to the alternatives. Uncertainty is handled by means of fuzzy concordance and discordance functions. The method is illustrated with a case study related to the recommendation of touristic activities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Our review paper research categorize the methods in the method of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) to find the method is widely used in the case of land clearing for plantation. Model FMCDM is used to assess the parameter in multi-criteria-based decision making. The dominant percentage of the result was obtained using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method. While the application of other methods for the same problem are Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Averaging (FOWA), Fuzzy Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite or Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (FELECTRE), Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS), Fuzzy, Artificial Neural Networks (FANNs) has less. Some the research result also implemented hybrid in FMCDM Method to give some weight in the assessment of decision making. There was also a paper which integrates FMCDM to the GIS method on the land clearing. Therefore, it is concluded that the issue on the land clearing can be done through collaboration of several models of FMCDM, so that it can be developed by involving the decision model using multi-stakeholder model. © 2015 International Journal of Advances in Intelligent Informatics.

abstract={The evidence of UNDESA framework of sustainability assessment in MCDM paradigm is scarce generically and particularly, the status of sustainability of Indian states has never been assessed in accordance with UNDESA 2007 framework. This paper is an attempt to explore the paradigm of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Methods in construction of sustainability index. To do so, we have used methods namely, Simple Additive Weighted Sum (SAWM), ELECTRE II, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE on the United Nations CSD indicators framework to evaluate the sustainability status of different states of India, which is among the fastest growing countries of todays world. We also try to understand the relative stability and distributional property of sustainability ranks obtained by different states. The ranks obtained by the different Methods are found to be relatively stable in comparative aspect. This implies that the choice of method does not make a big difference if the policy makers are interested for a group of entities to reward the superiors and support the laggards. On the other hand, a comprehensible and tractable method can be recommended for policy practice instead of less comprehensible one. Of course, use of a compendium of MCDM methods is always preferable for robustness analysis in decision-analytic aspect. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Decision Making is a branch of Operation Research (OR) having a comparatively short history of about 40 years. It is being popularly used in the field of engineering, banking, fixing policy matters etc. It can also be applied for taking decisions in daily life like selecting a car to purchase, selecting bride or groom and many others. Various MCDM methods namely Weighted Sum Model (WSM), Weighted Product Model (WPM), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) and Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) are there to solve many decision making problems, each having its own limitations. However it is very difficult to decide which MCDM method is the best. MCDM methods are prospective quantitative approaches for solving decision problems involving finite number of alternatives and criteria. Very few research works in textiles have been carried out with the help of this technique particularly where decision taking among several alternatives becomes the major problem based on some criteria which are conflicting in nature. Gradation of jute fibres on the basis of the criteria like strength, root content, defects, colour, density, fineness etc. is an important task to perform. The MCDM technique provides enough scope to be applied for the gradation of jute fibres or ranking among several varieties keeping in view a particular object and on the basis of some selection criteria and their relative weightage. The present paper is an attempt to explore the scope of applying the multiplicative AHP method of multi-criteria decision making technique to determine the quality values of selected jute fibres on the basis of some above stated important criteria and ranking them accordingly. A good agreement in ranking is observed between the existing Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) grading and proposed method. © 2014, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={In the last 30-40 years multicriteria-based approaches have been strongly applied to financial decision-making problems. The contributions that use multicriteria methodologies in order to evaluate the creditworthiness of debtors and loan applicants belong to this research field and mainly refer to applications of UTADIS and ELECTRE methods. In this paper authors themselves propose a deterministic approach for creditworthiness evaluation based on the multicriteria method known as MURAME, which has been applied for the first time to creditworthiness assessment problems by the authors themselves. The MURAME-based approach proposed by the authors is articulated in two phases: a rating assignment phase, and a rating quantification phase. The first one is mainly devoted to determine the debtors' rating classes, whereas the second phase allows to obtain estimates of the probabilities of default and of transition, and permits to calculate quantities providing further information about the (cardinal) rating and the (ordinal) ranking of the debtors' credit quality. The proposed approach is applied to an important northeastern Italian bank, the Banca Popolare di Vicenza, in order to evaluate the creditworthiness in a real case. © Marco Corazza, Stefania Funari, Federico Siviero, 2014.},

abstract={Spatial interpolation and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) capabilities of geographic information systems have the potential to create new approaches to forest management. In this study, the regularized spline with tension (RST) interpolation method and ELECTRE TRI MCDA was used to predict forest stand volumes in an area characterized by even-aged stands with heterogeneous structures in Turkey. Sampling data (1050 circular sample plots) were obtained from the National forest inventory. For each species and diameter class, a map of the predicted volume per ha was obtained using the RST method. By repeating the same process for the eight species occurring in the study area, 31 volume maps were produced. The accuracy of these prediction maps was assessed at pixel (20 x 20 m) and area scale (per ha). An accuracy of more than 97% was achieved at the pixel level, whereas a minimum accuracy of 86% was achieved for the area-based estimations. In addition, predicted values from the above 31 volume maps were compared with the observed values from management plan reports obtained from the Government Institute responsinble for forest management plans. The comparisons showed an accuracy of predictions of 21, 14, 4, and 2% for Calabrian pine, Oriental beech, black pine and oak species, respectively. Following interpolation, volume prediction maps were geo-computed, and a volume-based stand map was produced. The 890 different combinations of species composition and diameter classes were classified according to expert knowledge by the use of ELECTRE TRI MCDA, obtaining a final stand type map representing 70 different profile categories based on species mixture rates and diameter classes for the area analyzed. © iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.},

The objective of this article is to describe how we have assessed synergies between the Rio Conventions at the project level in the forest sector. Since the complexity of the decision problem is high, we adopted the Multicriteria Decision Aid approach, which can provide a broad insight into the decision problem and find a compromise solution to a problem with multidimensional and conflicting criteria including social, economic and environmental features. The ELECTRE TRI model was used for assessing synergies at the project level, and has been a useful tool to quantify the performance of afforestation and reforestation projects into three categories (synergistic, reasonably synergistic, and not synergistic). For the first time, afforestation and reforestation projects have been assessed in a comprehensive way through decision criteria that reflect global and local interests using a non-compensatory multicriteria method. © 2010 The Author(s).},

Under a subjective approach, we apply multi-criteria analysis to define the concept of highest social portfolio return. This concept is modeled as the best compromise solution of a 0-1 multi-objective optimization problem. Often powerful metaheuristics are required for solving real size problems, but with many objectives evolutionary algorithms are also inefficient. Such difficulty is overcome using a new method which incorporates decision-maker's preferences to the evolutionary search. We used a model based on a binary fuzzy outranking relation provided by electre methods for multi-criteria decision making. The proposal is examined through real size problems, in which good solutions are reached; examples illustrating the case of basic research project portfolios and social action program portfolios are shown here.},

abstract={The sourcing decision plays a major role in supply chain because raw materials/semi-finished goods cost constitute the key cost of final product. We develop a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, a compromise ranking model for evaluation and selection of sourcing partners to handle the conflicting and non-commensurable set of criteria and to identify the solution close to ideal. The modified VIKOR method is compared with two multi-criteria decision-making methods: technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE). All the three approaches were illustrated and compared for a computer retail supply chain case study. The better results of modified VIKOR are validated.

abstract={This paper presents a post-operation group decision making approach for multi-criteria material selection problems. In this approach, a group of materials experts are independently asked to assign their ordinal set of preferences over given design criteria. The solution process is then followed by deriving criteria weights for each designer using the revised Simos' method [1] and using them in the ELECTRE III decision making model [2]. Among different sets of ranking solutions obtained from different designers, the candidate materials that show the most stable (with least separations) and the highest ranks are considered as best compromised candidates. To account for decision separations from different designers while optimizing the rank, an overall loss function is defined for each material and used to make final group decisions. The application of the approach is shown using an illustrative example in material selection of a thermal loaded conductor cover sheet.},

By introducing a decision matrix, the revised Simos method is used to define a set of weighting factors and to perform the ranking stability analysis. A list of all possible choices from the best to the worst is then obtained using the ELECTRE III method (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality III) by taking into account all materials selection criteria, including the cost criterion. Finally, for a given case study, similarities and differences observed between the results of the proposed approach and those of earlier works are discussed.

This is illustrated by means of an experiment performed on the API commercial set of biochemical tests (identification of Enterobacteriaceae) with an ELECTRE-type model. It appears that the simultaneous use of conditional probability and ELECTRE models can improve the quality of identification.

abstract={The Portuguese National Health Service (SNS) was created to provide universal, equal, and tendentiously free care. There are different levels of care (primary, secondary, continued, and palliative) and all of them should deliver quality care services. Quality in healthcare is assessed according to several criteria, such as patient safety, care appropriateness or access. However, over the last years political and economic events have had an impact on the SNS. Hence, structural reforms have occurred, and new healthcare policies have been implemented, mostly focused on improving efficiency and reducing costs. It associated to divestment can increment barriers to access, compromise infrastructures and equipment, and, above all, the service's quality. This work aims to assess quality of the Portuguese public hospitals (secondary care providers) in this line. To this aim, we adopt a multiple criteria decision aiding approach, applying the ELECTRE TRI-NC method to build a decision model with intervention of an expert, who acts as the decision maker. Hospitals are assessed and assigned to predefined categories, taking into account the hospitals’ performances on various criteria. Each criterion is characterized by different subcriteria, resulting in a complex criteria tree. Thus, to construct a multidimensional scale for each criterion, we propose an innovative approach using an ELECTRE TRI-based method. The results are analyzed and the robustness of the model is tested. This work's findings may have potential application to healthcare policy and hospital funding in the SNS, in which financial sustainability is a permanent challenge. © 2021},

abstract={Biomass is one of the most convenient types of renewable energy resources around the world. Densely populated areas all over the globe produce a vast amount of mineral and organic wastes which can be perfect candidates for biomass energy generation. Therefore, the location in which a biomass power plant is installed is of utmost importance. In this research, feasibility of biomass energy generations has been studied by implementing the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Method. In order to perform this study, SAW, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE methods have been implemented using Shannon entropy mass method. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been carried out for 6 different criteria mass for all of the applied decision-making methods. In order to test and verify these models, appropriate areas in East and North East of Iran have been chosen. Afterward, selected cities in this area have been prioritized via various criteria, namely waste production per capita, slope, temperature, relative humidity, population, distance from fault, distance from road, distance from city center, precipitation, number of freezing days and altitude. Mass results indicated that population criterion had the highest mass, while altitude had the lowest mass. Additionally, prioritization results via all three methods unanimously showed that city of Mashhad, located in province of Razavi Khorasan, is the most appropriate spot to install a biomass power plant due to its high population. Furthermore, city of Nehbandan, located in Southern Khorasan, is the worst place for biomass power plant due to population index and distance from electrical power substation. TOPSIS showed the least sensitivity to criteria mass among the employed methods. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

The main objective of this paper is to analyze and precisely predict the occurrence of rank reversal in the ELECTRE II method. First, some useful properties of the optimal alternatives are obtained in the descending and ascending distillation processes. Second, two new concepts named combination relation digraph and numerator matrix are proposed to precisely analyze and greatly simplify the rank reversal in the ELECTRE II method. Third, all the reasons for the rank reversal in the ELECTRE II method are revealed more completely. Fourth, the necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for determining whether or not the rank reversal occurs in the ELECTRE II method. Additionally, the proposed methods in this paper are valid for analyzing the rank reversal in the ELECTRE method with discriminating thresholds. Finally, five examples are used to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of the methods that are proposed in this paper. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Science, technology and innovation (STI) policies are of great importance for countries to reach their sustainable development goals. Numerous global databases have many indicators that measure and compare the performance of STI policies of countries. However, many problems arise regarding how to identify, classify and systematically analyze these indicators in order to measure, monitor and improve the performance of STI. The study includes a literature review on global problems and new trends in STI policies, while mentioning the necessity of an internationally comparable STI indicator set, current STI indicator studies and efforts, and studies for each continent. In light of these, all the indicators selected are introduced in detail. The strengths and weaknesses of the countries in the study in terms of evaluation indicator values are indicated. After determining the indicator weights objectively with the entropy method, 40 countries are compared with TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE I-II, ARAS, COPRAS, MULTI-MOORA, ELECTRE, SAW and MAUT methods. In addition, countries that show similarities with each other are evaluated by cluster analysis, which is one of the data mining classification methods. This study offers a new and original approach with MCDM methods on this subject. Considering all the results obtained in the study together, these rankings are compared among themselves and with the rankings specified in the Global Innovation (2019) and Global Competitiveness (2019) indices, and it is seen that the results are consistent. In addition, it is possible to update and publish this study every year with updated data. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Hydrological and economic effects were assessed using the SWMM model and cost analysis, respectively. Different LID alternatives were evaluated using six different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches including TOPSIS, VICOR, SAW, MEW, ELECTRE III, and NFM. Due to differences in the ranking results of the MCDM methods, three aggregation methods of Rank average, Borda, and Copeland were used to reach consistency in the ranking. Rain barrel installation has been assessed as the most preferred LID alternative and the pervious asphalt as the least preferred one. The evaluation and ranking of the alternatives with MCDM approaches facilitated the effective prioritization of sustainable LID alternatives according to various management objectives. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={To satisfy their main goal, namely providing quality water to consumers, water distribution networks (WDNs) need to be suitably monitored. Only well designed and reliable monitoring data enables WDN managers to make sound decisions on their systems. In this belief, water utilities worldwide have invested in monitoring and data acquisition systems. However, good monitoring needs optimal sensor placement and presents a multi-objective problem where cost and quality are conflicting objectives (among others). In this paper, we address the solution to this multi-objective problem by integrating quality simulations using EPANET-MSX, with two optimization techniques. First, multi-objective optimization is used to build a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions relating contamination detection time and detection probability with cost. To assist decision makers with the selection of an optimal solution that provides the best trade-off for their utility, a multi-criteria decision-making technique is then used with a twofold objective: 1) to cluster Pareto solutions according to network sensitivity and entropy as evaluation parameters; and 2) to rank the solutions within each cluster to provide deeper insight into the problem when considering the utility perspectives.The clustering process, which considers features related to water utility needs and available information, helps decision makers select reliable and useful solutions from the Pareto front. Thus, while several works on sensor placement stop at multi-objective optimization, this work goes a step further and provides a reduced and simplified Pareto front where optimal solutions are highlighted. The proposed methodology uses the NSGA-II algorithm to solve the optimization problem, and clustering is performed through ELECTRE TRI. The developed methodology is applied to a very well-known benchmarking WDN, for which the usefulness of the approach is shown. The final results, which correspond to four optimal solution clusters, are useful for decision makers during the planning and development of projects on networks of quality sensors. The obtained clusters exhibit distinctive features, opening ways for a final project to prioritize the most convenient solution, with the assurance of implementing a Pareto-optimal solution. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is suggested to select the maintenance policy representing the best trade-off considering the complex and varied interdependencies amongst a diversity of clustered elements characterising the system. Then, the main risks related to the interventions associated to the selected maintenance policy are ranked using the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité III (ELECTRE III) method, using the same criteria weighted by the previous ANP application.

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems deliver various ecosystem services providing essential goods and services, on which humans depend. These include vital provision of water for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. Lake Pamvotis, a heavily modified urban lake is providing multiple services but at the same time is under multiple pressures. Setting as target the achievement of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) “Good Ecological Status or Potential” goal and acknowledging the revised River Basin Management Plan’s Program of Measures, a set of six alternatives is suggested. For the preferable alternatives’ selection, six criteria were adopted whose relations are given through a Driving Forces – Pressure - State-Impact - Responses (DPSIR) conceptual model. Qualitative judgments based on expert opinion are selected to describe the scores of the criteria which are finally evaluated as fuzzy numbers. A hybrid method which incorporates the outranking relation and the right of veto of the ELECTRE III method, and finally the net flow of the PROMETHEE method is developed. The proposed method is based on fuzzy sets and logic in order, firstly to interpret both the monocriterion comparison and the aggregation among the criteria and secondly to enable the evaluation of the criteria with fuzzy scores. The results prioritized the increase of the water quality for the improvement of water related ecosystem services among the other alternatives in all tests. The proposed method is suitable for environmental problems where the evaluation of the scores is not crisp and furthermore, commensurate alternatives are demanded. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={With the deteriorating ecological environment and increasing energy consumption, developing clean and renewable energy sources has become a key measure to solve environmental problems and energy shortages. The multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique is widely used in the assessment of renewable energy alternatives (REA) to determine the most sustainable and appropriate option for a country or region. Classic REA ranking is conducted in a deterministic environment through MCDM techniques. However, with the increasing complexity of environmental and energy issues, the REA ranking method is unsuitable for use in today's China. Therefore, in this paper, a fuzzy MCDM technique based on the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy elimination and choice expressing reality (IVHF-ELECTRE II) method, taking into account the uncertainty and ambiguity of the information, is proposed for REA ranking. A case study in China is conducted to elaborate on the rationality and feasibility of the proposed framework. According to the ranking results, hydro is determined as the best REA in China, followed by wind energy, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, biomass energy, and solar thermal. This research provides a feasible method and insightful reference for national decision-makers to utilize when evaluating the REA and establishing a macroplanning policy for renewable energy under an uncertain environment. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={There is increasing global interest in the potential commercial development of methane gas hydrate as a widespread and abundant unconventional source of natural gas. Previous work has focussed on understanding the nature and distribution of the resource, and potential recovery technology, neglecting assessment of the associated social, economic and environmental consequences. This gap needs to be addressed for any commercial gas hydrate development business case to succeed. Here we develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) protocol of gas hydrate development using the ELECTRE III method. Our protocol proposes criteria that evaluate the social, environmental and economic impacts of gas hydrate development proposals, which are weighted to represent the priorities of six identified stakeholder groups. We have tested the protocol on potential commercial gas hydrate development in Alaska through a series of interviews. Our results show that there is no universal preference structure, even within stakeholder groups, indicating that buy-in from all groups is a complex compromise. However, there are two fundamentally opposing groups, one composed of individuals from governmental and industry backgrounds who prioritise economic criteria, and another represented by members of the local community and environmental advocates who prioritise social and environmental criteria. The protocol concludes that gas hydrate development in Alaska is unlikely to be supported under present-day conditions. This work provides the first structured foundation for comprehensive assessment of future development proposals of gas hydrate or other natural resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The sport industry is currently an important sector of economic activity. In 2018, the global sports market was valued at nearly US$488.5 billionwith growth averaging at 4.3% since 2014. According to the European Commission Study on the Economic Impact of Sport through Sport Satellite Accounts, the share of sport-related Gross Domestic Product within the European Union equals 2.12 % (€279.7 billion), while the share of sport-related employment equals 2.72 % of total EU employment (5,666,195 persons).Due to the COVID-19 the global spectator sports market is expected to fall from US$144.2 billion in 2019 to US$139.5 billionin 2020. However, it is expected to recover and reach US$171.7 billion in 2023. The most popular and the most watched discipline in the world is football (soccer). It is one of a few sports played all over the world. According to FIFA, the 2018 World Cup in Russia reached 3.572 billion people (more than half the world) and the final was seen by 1.12 billion viewers. Football nowadays is not only a game and entertainment but also a billion dollar business. According to the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, the European football market recorded an increase of 2% since 2017/2018 season and is presently (2018/2019 season) worth €28.9 billion.Every year, about US$60 billionis pumped into sport through sponsorship deals. According to KPMG the total value of sponsorship across ‘big five’ leagues (Bundesliga in Germany, La Liga in Spain, Premier League in England, Ligue 1 in France and Serie A in Italy) in 2020 is more than €3.3 billion (US$3.8 billion). It is worth noting that front-of-shirt sponsorship represents nearly a third of this figure. In 2019, the biggest shirt sponsor of the leading 50 football clubs in Europe was the airline industry (€207 million). The second place was taken by the automotive industry (€159 million).Companies from Middle East spend most on European shirt sponsorships (€250 million). They are followed by Japan (€106 million). It is believed that football sponsorship allows companies to raiseboth brand awareness and profits as well as enter new markets.Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the potential of being sponsored of six selected Polish football clubs competing in the Ekstraklasa(the top division of Polish football) in 2019/2020 season.An original approach that we called MAMIMCA – Multiple Assessment Multiple Importance Multiple Criteria Analysis – was adopted to choose the most suitable football club to sponsor. In the evaluation conducted three different aspects were taken into account (sport, finance and commerciality, i.e. media attention and fan community), four well-established multi-criteria decision aiding methods were used (PROMETHEE II and EXPROM II with veto thresholds, modified ELECTRE III and TOPSIS) and four different vectors of weights were applied. As the result the ranking of six selected clubs was obtained, accordance to the three criteria mentioned above used in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of football clubs. © JPES.},

abstract={The paper shows how multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tools can support the analyses of six hypotheses of adaptive reuse of an iconic historical building in Turin, Italy (called stock exchange) to identify the preferred alternative. In the last 2 years, the debate around the requalification of the building has been huge for several reasons: it is perceived as a “monument” by citizens; it shows architectural and typological values nationally recognized; it involves public and private interests. In this context, we tested the applicability of a recently proposed multicriteria decision making methodology to architecture field. This decision support approach is a conjunction of four MCDA methods, namely: multiple criteria hierarchy process (MCHP), permitting to consider structural relationships between criteria; ELECTRE III, considering three types of interaction effects between criteria (strengthening, weakening and antagonistic effects); the imprecise SRF method, supplying an easily understandable approach to collect information from the Decision Maker; and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA), providing robust recommendation, in terms of rankings and relations of preference, indifference and incomparability between project alternatives, at each level of the hierarchy. We propose a modification of the SRF methodology, called SFR-II, to increase the reliability of the decision aid procedure, which could constitute a significant advance for the same SRF method. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the development of cloud computing, more and more resources are provided in the form of cloud services. Then how to select suitable cloud service for users without professional knowledge has become an important issue. Existing cloud service selection models are usually considered as QoS-aware evaluation focused models. In practice, the QoS attributes have problems like subjectivity, vagueness, and uncertainty, and a range of formats are involved to describe QoS attributes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the heterogeneous formats of QoS attributes in cloud service selection process. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel cloud service selection approach using entropy weight and GRA-ELECTRE III that can handle heterogeneous QoS attributes simultaneously. In the proposed approach, heterogeneous QoS attributes are handled simultaneously by being transformed into intuitionistic fuzzy numbers; the relative weights of QoS attributes are calculated objectively by the extended entropy measure method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment; and cloud services are evaluated by GRA-ELECTRE III integrated method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has good stability and discrimination in dealing with heterogeneous data and can effectively avoid compensation between attributes. © 2020 Mingming Liu et al.},

abstract={Construction diversion is necessary for damming, and First-Stage Diversion Scheme Selection (FDSS) is of significance in damming process control. To effectively select the first-stage diversion scheme, a theoretical Decision-Making Framework (DMF) is presented and its decision-making basis includes diversion risk, costs, social attitudes and duration. With multiple aspects of concerns, the FDSS can be solved by Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods and the complex diversion risk assessment can be achieved by the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Mutual Inspection (MI) is based on a MADM feature of Partially Different Results (PDR), which should involve different MADM methods in solving the same problem and can reduce method difference-derived error within MADM results by mutually contrasting the PDR and refining ranking messages. Basing on these theoretical studies, the DMF for FDSS is developed, which contains two parts, the Risk Detector that assesses diversion risk of alternatives through MCS and the Decision Solver that undertakes decision-making preliminary and MADM enhanced by MI for solving FDSS. To demonstrate the DMF with MI, a case study that applies suitable MADM methods (viz. TOPSIS and ELECTRE I) for carrying out MI is conducted. Case results show that the DMF can solve the FDSS as it selects the optimal (S6) among six alternatives, the MI can enhance the DMF as it refines ranking messages about alternatives in the final MADM results. The DMF with MI can benefit the damming industry and contribute to the overall water resources management. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={An appropriate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions’ institution largely affects long-term development of cement corporates. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate a scientific method for selecting an optimal institution for a cement corporate. The paper mainly makes the following contributions to effectively resolving this selection problem. Given the capacity of picture 2-tuple linguistic sets (P2TLSs) in depicting voting information, they are used as evaluation representation in this case. Another contribution is that this paper newly proposes a prospect theory-based score function to rank picture 2-tuple linguistic numbers (P2TLNs). The proposed score function effectively overcomes the limitations in the existing score function by considering the voting potential of those decision-makers (DMs) who hold “abstain” opinion. Meanwhile, this proposed score function also adequately considers the rational-bounded behavior of DMs, thereby making the evaluation more approximate to the reality. Furthermore, this paper investigates a hybrid outranking method to select institution in the context of P2TLSs. It takes different types of preference functions and the Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method into account simultaneously. Compared with other similar type methods, this hybrid method can flexibly choose criteria type and provide specific values to represent quantitative dominance relation rather than qualitative judgment. Finally, an illustrative example and comparative analyses are provided to certify the availability and reliability of the proposed method. © 2018, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of selecting a suitable location for a fire station in canton of Fribourg, as a result of a fire brigades' merger, by applying Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods. Solving the problem of determining fire station locations through various methods has been analyzed in-depth by researchers. However, a different approach, based on application of ELECTRE I and ELECTRE II methods is advanced in this paper. The selection of the most suitable fire station site is obtained by applying the designated methods to five distinctive alternatives (called scenarios), taking into consideration the relatively limited information and specifics, and the extensive number of relevant criteria that summed up to sixty-one. Taking the merger of the three local fire departments as an example, the proposed methods for selecting a suitable location for the fire station demonstrate and justify the reason behind this choice. Research shows that the applied methods have been proven to be useful and powerful tools that exhibited acceptable levels of consistency when selecting the best project. The main finding is that one scenario in particular proved to be preferred over the others and most suitable in determining the fire station location. © 2018 Marino Widmer, published by Sciendo.},

abstract={The most appropriate organizational software is always a real challenge for managers, especially, the IT directors. The illustration of the term "enterprise software selection", is to purchase, create, or order a software that; first, is best adapted to require of the organization; and second, has suitable price and technical support. Specifying selection criteria and ranking them, is the primary prerequisite for this action. This article provides a method to evaluate, rank, and compare the available enterprise software for choosing the apt one. The prior mentioned method is constituted of three-stage processes. First, the method identifies the organizational requires and assesses them. Second, it selects the best method throughout three possibilities; indoor-production, buying software, and ordering special software for the native use. Third, the method evaluates, compares and ranks the alternative software. The third process uses different methods of multi attribute decision making (MADM), and compares the consequent results. Based on different characteristics of the problem; several methods had been tested, namely, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTURE), and easy weight method. After all, we propose the most practical method for same problems. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water and its demand management has a significant impact on water resources of arid areas. This research proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to prioritize agricultural water demand management (AWDM) strategies based on surveys carried out with 35 Iranian experts in an arid region. It hybridized the advantages of the modified technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (MTOPSIS) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methods, and it is called MTAHP. The AHP model is used to determine the relative weights and consistency ratio assessment and finally the MTOPSIS model is used to rank the strategies. Moreover, ELimination and Choice Expressing REality III (ELECTRE III) as a non-compensatory model and simple additive weighting (SAW) as a compensatory model were used for comparison with the proposed model. The proposed model result was similar to the SAW model but different from ELECTRE III. High-ranked strategies are training farmers, improvement of cropping patterns and land levelling and modernization of the irrigation systems in the region, respectively. The results of this research show the ability of the hybrid model of AHP and MTOPSIS to prioritize the strategies for AWDM which is recommended for other similar regions.

abstract={the challenge in Zero energy building (ZEB) design is to find the best combination of design strategies that would face the energy performance problems of a particular building. This paper outlines the methodology and the cost-effectiveness potential for optimizing the design of net-zero energy building (NZEB) in a cold climate region in Lebanon; Cedars. Specifically, the non-sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is chosen in order to minimize thermal, electrical demands and life cycle cost (LCC) while reaching the net zero energy balance; and thus getting the Pareto-front. A ranking decision making technique (ELECTRE III) is applied to the Pareto-front so as to obtain one optimal solution. A wide range of energy efficiency measures are investigated, besides solar energy systems are employed to produce required electricity and hot water for domestic purposes. The results clearly indicate that, for designing a residential NZEB in cold climate, it is essential to minimize the space thermal load through a building envelope with high thermal performance. Envelop high level of insulation is an essential step to decrease the high heating demand. Building thermal loads are decreased by 33.19%. Moreover the LCC is decreased by 31.09%. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={China is one of the disaster-prone countries in the world. Constructing a rapid and effective relief logistic system is important for disaster-responding at country level. Strategic prepositioning of emergency items, especially the decision of appropriate emergency warehouses location, has significant impacts on rapid disaster response to ensure sufficient relief supplies. The emergency warehouse location decision is a complex problem, where a wide variety of criteria need to be considered and the preference information of decision makers (DMs) may be imprecise or even absent. In this paper, we identify key effectiveness-oriented criteria used to evaluate the alternative emergency warehouse locations and make an attempt to propose a new multicriteria ranking method to solve the problem of inaccurate or uncertain weight information based on stochastic pairwise dominant relations and the pruning procedure of ELECTRE-II method. The proposed method extends the conventional ELECTRE-II method by incorporating inaccurate information and broadens its application to emergency warehouse location field. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated with a simulated example. © 2017 Junkang He et al.},

abstract={Nowadays enterprises should consider seeking to reduce the supply chain risks as a crucial part of their activities in order to improve their competitiveness in the international context. Choosing the suitable strategy in connection with assigning some parts of the production process to outside the organization is a complex multi-criteria decision making problem and it gets more complicated when supply chain risk factors as the factors to select the strategy as well as dependence and the close ties between these criteria also be considered. In this paper, after the identification of risks in the supply chain of a medical equipment manufacturer company, dependence and ties between criteria in line with choosing the best strategy among existing alternatives has been examined in the form of a combined ANP-ELECTRE method. This combined model has high performance to give a solution to the problem considered in this paper. Because of the complexity and time consuming nature of the AHP and ELECTRE, in this study a metaheuristic algorithm is developed called SIMANP that despite the simplicity of computing and high-speed, is good in the terms of precision and efficiency. The results of comparing SIMANP algorithm and the proposed ANP -ELECTRE method are presented at the end of the paper. © 2017 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cultivated gently since some hundred 60 years coordinated action planning has become necessary to conserve lands while keeping good agro-production. Some of the authors were engineers trained here and other had former experience in Salta, Argentina, using a set of Decision Theory Methods, (DTM), to consider the possible systems of soil uses and actions to be recommended. After having improved data on soils and on hydrology for the study area, they have adapted as academic study these DTM for Arroyos Menores areas where gully erosions are severe, also intending to offer better view for the necessary planning to have policies of actions and uses, done by the local society decision and services, and in part by land owners. This paper concentrates on the application of a set of discrete multi-criteria models (MCDM), where alternatives were global, considering soil conservation and hydrologic management actions, and main types of use of soil, and where criteria were about the diverse consequences, grouped as environmental, economic, and social. As methods they have used for the sub areas PROMETHEE with sets of weights, comparing results with ELECTRE with same data and weights, and with AHP method needing comparisons of criteria by authors, getting somehow compatible results, but finding that the “weighted PROMETHEE II” was the more adapted for the present study. The system and results are very global, and are offered as indications for planning, that will require using detailed engineering and administration aspects for series of local singular actions or for management pursued in time. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this paper we applied multi-criteria methods of decision in order to establish the best encapsulation material to be used in producing photovoltaic modules. The encapsulation materials play an important role in establishing the PV module performance, especially if referring to their ability to increase their life time. For our study, we have considered the most widely used encapsulation materials available on the market, such as Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA), Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB), Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU), PolyDimethylsiloxane (PDMS), Ionomer. Amongst of their basic properties, we took into consideration the light transmittance, refractive index, thermal conductivity, volume resistivity, and water vapor transmission rate. In the paper herein, two multi-criteria methods, namely the Simple Additive Weighting method and ELECTRE (ELimination and Choice Expressing Reality) method are applied in order to establish a hierarchy of the mentioned encapsulation materials. It is also shown that the final hierarchy of materials depends on the importance given to the criteria involved. By considering all the mentioned properties and the economical aspect, in particular the cost, the first position in the hierarchy is occupied by EVA. If the cost is eliminated, the hierarchy changes and EVA becomes outranked by other materials, as PDMS and Ionomer. © 2016, Gh. Asachi Technical University of Iasi. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Outranking relations such as produced by the Electre I or II or the Tactic methods are based on a concordance and non-discordance principle that leads to declaring that an alternative is “superior” to another, if the coalition of attributes supporting this proposition is “sufficiently important” (concordance condition) and if there is no attribute that “strongly rejects” it (non-discordance condition). Such away of comparing alternatives is rather natural and does not require a detailed analysis of tradeoffs between the various attributes. However, it is well known that it may produce binary relations that do not possess any remarkable property of transitivity or completeness. The axiomatic foundations of outranking relations have recently received attention. Within a conjoint measurement framework, characterizations of reflexive concordance–discordance relations have been obtained. These relations encompass those generated by the Electre I and II methods, which are non-strict (reflexive) relations. A different characterization has been provided for strict (asymmetric) preference relations such as produced by Tactic. In this paper we briefly review the various kinds of axiomatizations of outranking relations proposed so far in the literature. Then we analyze the relationships between reflexive and asymmetric outranking relations in a conjoint measurement framework, consolidating our previous work. Co-duality plays an essential rôle in our analysis. It allows us to understand the correspondence between the previous characterizations. Making a step further, we provide a common axiomatic characterization for both types of relations. Applying the co-duality operator to concordance–discordance relations also yields a new and interesting type of preference relation that we call concordance relation with bonus. The axiomatic characterization of such relations results directly from co-duality arguments. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model, the hybrid model is compared to the situation where the non-hybrid model was applied.

abstract={Assessing vulnerability to climate change allows policymakers to prioritize policy interventions and better allocate resources. Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA) can play an important role in developing long-term environmental and infrastructure plans. Typically, a CCVA exercise combines knowledge from multiple disciplines (e.g., climate science, public health, social science, infrastructure systems, economics) in order to build models of the vulnerability to a climate-related stress of a valued attribute (e.g., health, prosperity, security) of a socio ecological system (SES) (e.g., local government area, councils, counties). In indicator-based vulnerability assessments (IBVA), indicators are adopted as proxy measures of processes generating vulnerability. However, some of the widely recognized challenges of IBVA have been the absence of a mathematically robust framework that can combine information from different knowledge domains, while taking into account the partial compensation of loss/gain between indicators, nonlinearities, and tipping points. In one of our previous papers we showed that even though their goals are fundamentally different, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and IBVA have the same structural features. Hence, we proposed an aggregation framework for IBVA using insights from the older and more mature field of MCDA (El-Zein and Tonmoy, 2013a) . The goal of this paper is to extend this framework in order to define and deal with non-linear relationships and threshold effects commonly occurring in IBVA. We first identify different sources of non-linearity present in the context of IBVA. We distinguish between a fundamental nonlinearity (dependence of vulnerability on magnitude of stress), a deductive nonlinearity (where a deductive or mechanistic model is required to identify the relationship between a set of indicators and vulnerability) and an intuitive nonlinearity (where the same relationship is characterized as non-linear through inductive arguments by stakeholders and/or experts). Second, we build a new framework called the Sydney Environmental Vulnerability Assessment (SEVA) by introducing harm as a concept that replaces or mediates the relationship between the indicator and the vulnerability it represents. Harm can be conceived of as a more concrete, less abstract form of vulnerability that is more amenable to quantification. A harm criterion then, like an indicator, acts as a proxy for a process generating vulnerability. However, a harm criterion allows us to achieve two key objectives: a) to relax the conditions concerning linearity, and b) to separate deductive and intuitive nonlinearities in order to better deal with both of them. SEVA conducts aggregation of harm criteria using an outranking framework. In a previous paper, we showed that outranking methods, developed in decision science, are better suited to IBVA because their theoretical requirements are less stringent than multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) approaches, and do not require perfect knowledge of preference structures (El-Zein and Tonmoy, 2013a). Outranking procedures are especially powerful in dealing with partial compensation and fuzzy relationships and, through SEVA (Figure 1), we extend the capability of an outranking procedure (ELECTRE III) to deal with the nonlinearities defined above. We simulate various combinations of nonlinearities and partial compensation through specific definitions of thresholds of differences (which are basic parameters of fuzziness in outranking algorithms). We demonstrate the use of SEVA by applying it to a hypothetical model of vulnerability of beach residents to sea level rise and its associated processes. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.},

abstract={Purpose – Industrial companies are continuously looking to improve their business turn-over and choose improvement actions to achieve this objective. Legitimating this choice by only a strategic financial point of view currently has some limits, because additional ones such as quality, delay, resources needs have also to be taken into account. The multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approaches have been developed to deal with problems such as ranking, sorting or quantification. The purpose of this paper is to describe the operational aspects in MCDA deployment through a case study submitted by the SME Fournier Company. Design/methodology/approach – This paper concerns analytical overall performance models to allow the decision-makers (DMs) to select potential actions to launch regarding given decision criteria. The principles of the main MCDA approaches, outranking and aggregation, are presented. Then representative MCDA methods, ELECTREIII and MACBETH, are successively deployed to a tactical decision problem of business turn-over increase. From the building of their respective preference modelling, decision aid is provided in the form of preference relation or performance function. Findings – A formal framework supplying information to the industrial DMs in order to legitimate the action selection is described. In addition, the DMs feedback highlights the required expertise for the preference modelling. Practical implications – The article gives a guideline for industrial practitioners to carry out ELECTREIII and MACBETH for their improvement action selection. Originality/value – SMEs can find an adapted framework for their improvement actions choice dealing with financial and non-financial criteria. It is also enriched by practical considerations concerning the methods deployment for tactical decision problems. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) aims at helping a Decision Maker (DM) in the representation of his preferences over a set of alternatives, on the basis of several criteria which are often contradictory. In addition to the presence of a DM, MCDA process requires a specification of criteria, alternatives and preferential information given by the DM. Hence many methods have been developed in order to solve MCDA problems (ELECTRE methods, AHP, etc.). The interconnexion between MCDA and risk analysis has been proved. MCDA methods can be used to solve risk analysis problems such as: • Computation of a risk scale: it can be done by using MCDA methods as ELECTRE TRI or by MACBETH methodology when the scale is quantitative; • The evaluation of remediation solutions after an accident. We present in this paper the Decision Deck (DD) project (http://www.decision-deck.org/) which aims at collaboratively developing Open Source software tools implementing MCDA. These tools constitute an open source platform available for all communities, not only for MCDA community. We show how MCDA methods implemented in Decision Deck can be useful for risk analysis, especially in risk assessment and remediation risk management. Thus, Decision Deck can be interpreted as a bridge between MCDA and riskanalysis. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study aims to test whether or not the ELECTRE-III method is successful in determining the company with the highest performance in the sector by ranking the companies in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) - Retail Sector. The ELECTRE-III method was chosen on the grounds that it successfully guides the decision-making process and facilitates detection by eliminating the problems concerning decisionmaking in situations that offer a great number of alternatives with different features. The financial statements of the companies, which were active in the ISE Retail Sector between the years 2008 and 2010, arranged in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were used in the research. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={Problem Oriented Approach in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), requires that outcomes of water resources development be assessed based on water resources sustainability at basin level. In planning models, assessment of options and structural and non-structural actions and plans are also assessable based on the variations of these criteria in view of the current situation. Hence, study and prioritization of options in Iran entails the selection and measurement of water resources sustainability criteria at basin level. Agriculture sector as the world's main consumer of water has a significant role in water allocation in different countries. In the present study, three multi-criteria decision making methods of AHP, TOPSIS and ELECTRE have been used to rank the feasibility of agricultural development in second order basins of Iran. Next, existing trend of agricultural development will be compared with the obtained rankings of MCDM methods. Results reveal that there are signs of agricultural disharmonious and unsustainable development in some of second order basins of Iran.},

Nowadays, there does not exist any process based upon a rigorous method to select the best clone to be plant in order to get the highest return on investment. The only known selection method is to use the experience of different protagonists acting in the plantation. So, we need a tool that takes into account very important criteria in order to achieve the main objective. This goal is achieved by using multicriterion analysis methods to the clone selection. The ranking procedure uses Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE III). For each criterion, indifference and preference thresholds are determined after establishing the relative importance of each criterion including rubber tapping, cumulative production during 15-years, cumulative production between 15 and 25-years, wind resistance, disease resistance, physiological resistance, grafting and quality of the rubber. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In the recent years, the environmental problems have reached to a vital extent, which is pushing the boundaries and far beyond dairy evaluations. Industrial plants, the energy sources and uncontrolled release of pollutant gases (SO2, CO2 efc.) in the production stage have the greatest share in the occurrence of unfavorable environmental conditions. For this reason, the dimension of the problems that may arise in the production stage of industrial plants is directly related to the selection of facility location. In this study, geographical regions (a total of 7 regions) of our country have been analyzed in terms of environmental values based on their basins and the unfavorable environmental problems that are currentjy being experienced. Considered as such, with the directives of an expert group composed of nature scientists, the criteria and alternative areas are determined using the data gathered on ecosystem, basin ch and land types. Since the primary goal is to keep the environmental damages at the minimum level, comprehensive definition of the problem is constructed by consultation of the expert group and the crteria are determined. Considering the fact that it will prevent the drawbacks generated by making decisions depending on certain stereotypes to a great extent, ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality English - Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Reale) method is used to determine in which geographic region our country's industrial plants should be located. © 2011 Triveni Enterprises Vikas Nagar, Lucknow, INDIA.},

abstract={With globalization and the emergence of the extended enterprise of interdependent organizations, there has been a steady increase in good suppliers'demands. This leads firms to give more importance to the purchasing function and its associated decisions. The process of supplier selection is very complex in the supply chain management, which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors, and belongs to the category of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). During recent years, how to determine suitable suppliers has become a key strategic consideration. In this paper, the methods of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ELECTRE are mainly studied to select suppliers scientifically. First, evaluation indexes for supplier selection are constructed; second, epurating these quantitative and qualitative indexes is finished by the method of PCA; last, the suitable one can be selected from all those suppliers by the method of ELECTRE. This paper shows that the proposed process is very well suited as a decision-making combinatorial tool for supplier selection decisions. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Even in developing countries that are faced with ecological and socio-economic problems, agricultural areas are constrained by land-use laws to be developed in particular ways. This being the case, the major issues in these areas are a better quality of life and sustainable use of the limited resources. This necessitates planning for sustainable development and evaluating various qualitative and quantitative data in a single framework. Multicriteria or multipurpose decision analysis methods are appropriate for this purpose. Using these methods, physical, economical and social data, as well as planning goals, can be combined and evaluated in the context of sustainable development. These multicriteria methods have been documented widely in a variety of problem areas, but two multicriteria methods, namely AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and ELECTRE II (elimination and choice translating reality), have not been used extensively in agricultural land-use decisions in developing countries. However, in situations where decision-making criteria are non-commensurable, non-comparable or non-countable, and when it is necessary to evaluate the criteria together, as in agricultural land-use decisions, AHP and ELECTRE II methods are warranted. This study reviews these methods briefly and suggests their potential application in the agricultural land-use decision process in a developing country. For this purpose, these methods were sampled in Ziyaret Stream Basin in Adiyaman, which is part of the Güneydoǧu Anadolu Projesi (GAP) (South-eastern Anatolian Project) in the Republic of Turkey. The area could be characterized by its rural and agricultural features, although it is under the pressure of Adiyaman urban development. This study shows that both AHP and ELECTRE II methods can be applied successfully for the determination of agricultural land-use priorities, which are an essential part of the quality of life and of sustainable land-use studies. © CAB International 2005.},

This means that these MADM methods do not satisfy the conditions of consistent choice: independence of the value scale (IV), and descriptive invariability (DI). Also, it is shown that the MADM methods violate the contraction consistency condition α: If an alternative A is the best in a set S of alternatives, then it should be the best in any subset of S to which it belongs.

The high-enthalpy facilities used are the ONERA hot-shot F4 and the DLR Stalker tube HEG. The simple configurations are the nozzle, the Electre blunt cone, the hyperboloid flare, and the 70° blunt cone. In addition to these axisymmetric configurations, the Halis/Orbiter configuration was extensively tested and numerically computed to validate the ground-to-flight extrapolation methodology. Real-gas effects on aerodynamic forces and in particular on pitching moment for the Halis have been reproduced in the F4 and compared with flight. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for additional improvements in nozzle calibrations using non-intrusive methods, and for an increased use of computational fluid dynamics for the design of experiments, the definition of the test environment, the interpretation of the results and for extrapolation to flight.},

Intuitively, a RFA is the model of a reactive system which may store event occurrences that must not be immediately taken into account. We show that, contrarily to lossy systems where the reachability set is recognizable but not effectively computable, (1) the reachability set of a RFA is recognizable, and (2) it is effectively computable. Moreover, we also study the relationships between RFAs and Finite Automata and we prove that (3) from a trace language point of view, inclusions between RFAs and Finite Automata are undecidable and (4) the linear temporal logic LTL on states without the temporal operator next is decidable for RFAs, while LTL on transitions is undecidable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

abstract={Purpose: Understanding the relational factors in information technology outsourcing (ITO) processes is essential for managers to exercise successful governance over their relationship. Based on this premise, this paper aims to present a study about relational factors using judgments of managers from small and medium-sized supplying and contracting companies involved in ITO relationships, helping to understand the differences between what they believe to be relevant for maintaining the relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical approach consisted of applying fuzzy sets theory elements, converting the managers' judgments into crisp values through a defuzzification process, and the multicriteria method ELECTRE IV that created the rankings of the relational factors according to the defuzzified judgments. The approach was applied with 16 managers from supplying companies and 34 from contracting companies, in both cases located in a large Brazilian pole of information technology. Findings: The main findings indicate that suppliers are initially more concerned with contractual aspects, being in the highest positions in the ranking: detailed contract, service level agreement and costs. Only after these elements, suppliers prioritize aspects less linked to the contract. For contractors, customer relationship management is the most important, followed by costs and commitment by managers, which indicates more openness to issues-oriented to relational development. Originality/value: The approach adopted in this article is differentiated by prioritizing relational factors that are not always directly perceived in ITO relationships. Another important consideration is that most studies focus only on the perspective of supplier selection by contracting companies. In this paper, both suppliers' and contractors' judgments on the importance of ITO relational factors were analyzed, creating rankings that supported understanding the difference between the two perspectives. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The present paper addresses the relevant topic of maintenance management, widely recognised as a fundamental issue involving complex engineering systems and leading companies towards the optimisation of their assets while pursuing cost efficiency. With this regard, our research aims to provide companies with a hybrid methodological approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) capable to deal with the main failures potentially involving complex systems subjected to predictive maintenance. Such an approach is going to be integrated within the framework of traditional Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), whose strengths and weaknesses are considered. In particular, the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is suggested to sort failure modes into risk priority classes while the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed to highlight the most influencing failures within each risk class. The approach is applied to a real service system, whose critical components are monitored by sensors and subjected to predictive maintenance. Final results clearly demonstrate as highlighting the elements impacting the occurrence of other failures within specific risk classes is a significant driver towards the implementation of effective maintenance, maximising the whole level of performance of the analysed system over its lifecycle. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) constitutes a family of out-ranking multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods that has been adopted by researchers from many areas during the last years. It provides reliable and clear results thanks to the advantages of different types of preference functions. In this paper, we incorporate the benefits of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (for short, q-ROFS) in this strategy of solution. This model, q-ROFS, is a generalized form of Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), as it broadens the space of acceptable orthopairs and has an ability to deal with more elaborate and vague information. The technique of our extension of the PROMETHEE method uses q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers to render the ratings of alternatives, which allows us to express uncertain and vague information more accurately. The usual criterion preference function has been used to measure the preferences of the alternatives. A partial ordering of alternatives is obtained by considering the outgoing and incoming flows of alternatives, which is known as PROMETHEE I. Furthermore, a complete ordering is accomplished by taking into account the procedure of PROMETHEE II. As a numerical exercise, we consider the selection of a contractor for a construction project. A full analysis is performed to illustrate the application of the technique that stems from our approach. Then we compare the results that we obtain with the results from existing ap-proaches, including q-rung orthopair fuzzy ELECTRE, q-rung orthopair fuzzy TOPSIS, q-rung orthopair fuzzy VIKOR and q-rung orthopair fuzzy aggregation operators. In this way the accuracy and effectiveness of the presented work is conclusively validated. © 2021, University of Sistan and Baluchestan. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Urban public transport systems must be economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. Available decision support systems, including multiple criteria decision models, allow identifying which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable and those that should no longer be used in efficient and environmentally friendly cities. Previous research has ranked urban public transport vehicles by applying analytic hierarchy process multi-criteria decision-making models, from economic and non-polluting perspectives. However, until now, the types of vehicles acceptable for fleet renewal have not been identified. This study proposes a consistent combination of the ELECTRE TRI multiple criteria decision sorting method and the DELPHI procedure, the objective of which is to identify which urban public transport vehicles are acceptable, taking into consideration a suggested sustainable threshold, which includes economic and environmental strict requirements. The proposed model is based on 2020 Madrid urban public road transport data, published by Madrid City Council, which were compiled by the authors, and assessed by a panel of 20 experts to identify criteria and factors included in the model. Findings help local administrations to identify which urban public transport vehicles should be progressively replaced by those classified as economically efficient and additionally environmentally sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Considering ergonomic factors in assembly line balancing problems can significantly improve human ergonomic conditions. In this study, a two-stage framework is developed to balance a mixed-model parallel U-shaped assembly line by considering ergonomic risks. In the first stage, according to various ergonomic standards and using the best-worst method and ELECTRE TRI, ergonomic risks of each task are identified and each task is classified into hard, normal, or easy class. In the second stage, a mathematical model of the problem is developed by considering a new objective function to level the number of tasks of each class between stations. This objective ensures that the tasks of each class are distributed equally among stations, resulting in having a roughly equal number of hard, normal, and easy tasks in each station. To solve the problem, a constraint programming model and a heuristic algorithm are developed. Numerical results show that the proposed objective function can level ergonomic risks well. The performance of the proposed solution approaches is examined against six different metaheuristic algorithms. Numerical results indicate the superiority of the constraint programming model for small and medium-size problems and that of the heuristic algorithm for large-size problems. © 2021},

abstract={Satisfying the clients' uncompromising priorities is a challenge for decision makers of organizations that face multiple projects. This paper considers an organization with a multi-skilled workforce working on several predetermined projects under time-of-use energy tariffs where distributed load energy usage is the primary concern of energy suppliers. This paper also considers different time-of-use energy tariffs, which are among the most common strategies to reach a more balanced energy utilization. The problem is stated as a bi-objective mixed-integer programming model containing two conflicting objectives; to minimize the total cost of the multi-skilled workforce and obtain a sustainable schedule with minimum deviation from the projects' priorities. The problem is formulated mathematically, and the GAMS solver is applied for justifying the conflict between the objectives and validating the proposed formulation. In order to tackle real-life instances of the problem, intelligent algorithms based on cuckoo search, particle swarm, and genetic algorithms are developed. In the proposed algorithms, the application of a well-designed encoding and decoding structure efficiently ensures the generated solutions' feasibility. The Taguchi method is used for calibrating the parameters of the proposed meta-heuristics. Performance of the solving methods is evaluated based on some experiments, where ELECTRE method is utilized as a decision-making technique to prioritize the developed algorithms. To this aim, some well-known multi-objective measures are applied for comparative analysis of the results, where the supremacy of FSCS in terms of all metrics is declared. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={CAT-SD (Categorization by Similarity-Dissimilarity) is a multiple criteria decision aiding method for dealing with nominal classification problems (predefined and non-ordered categories). Actions are assessed according to multiple criteria and assigned to one or more categories. A set of reference actions is used to define each category. The assignment of an action to a given category depends on the comparison of the action to each reference set according to likeness thresholds. Distinct sets of criteria weights, interaction coefficients, and likeness thresholds can be defined per category. When applying CAT-SDto complex decision problems, it may be useful to consider a hierarchy of criteria to give a more intelligible vision of the performances of the considered actions. We propose to apply Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process to CAT-SD to take into account criteria structured in a hierarchical way. On the basis of the known deck of cards method, we also consider an imprecise elicitation of parameters permitting to consider interactions and antagonistic effects between criteria. The elicitation procedure we are proposing can be applied to any Electre method. With the purpose of exploring the assignments obtained by CAT-SD considering possible sets of parameters, we propose to apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). The SMAA methodology allows to draw statistical conclusions on the classification of the actions. The proposed method, SMAA-hCat-SD, helps the decision maker to check the effects of the variation of parameters on the classification at different levels of the hierarchy. We propose also a procedure, based on the concept of loss function, to get a deterministic classification fulfilling some requirements given by the decision maker and taking into account the hierarchy of criteria and the probabilistic assignments obtained through SMAA.

abstract={To evaluate the comprehensive impacts of tourism in Hainan, this paper proposes an approach integrating input-output (IO) model with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. Four steps are taken: (1) constructing an extended IO model that can separate out domestic and imported effects from the traditional IO system; (2) constituting a 3-level evaluation criteria hierarchy based on various tourism multipliers obtained from the extended IO model; (3) calculating the weights of criteria using the entropy theory; (4) giving an evaluation of comprehensive impacts of tourism based on four MCDM methods – WSM, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, and PROMETHEE. Using Hainan 2002, 2007, and 2012 IO tables as database, the proposed approach is implemented in the empirical study of Hainan. The results show economic dimension is the most important consideration and the overall performance of tourism in Hainan shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing from 2002 to 2012. Two types sensitivity analysis of weights show single criterion weight change has little influence on the results. But it is different when four dimensions weights change. Especially, when the environmental dimension is valued, the overall performance gets worse annually. These findings can offer insightful policies for the development of Hainan’s tourism. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as one of the most cost-effective means aiming at reducing energy consumption while maintaining an equivalent level of economic activity. Mainstreaming EE financing is considered a key priority to avert climate change. The lack of evidence on the performance, commonly agreed procedures and standards for EE investments, particularly during the first stages of investment generation and pre-selection/pre-evaluation, are the key problems hampering EE investment financing. It is also true that often project developers do not have the expertise or resources to make a convincing financing case for investors. In order to boost EE investments, this paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology intending to support financing institutions to identify attractive EE project ideas in the early development phase of project initiation and planning. The study implements the ELECTRE TRI method to benchmark EE project ideas in a standardized, investor recognizable credit rating form. A respective web-based tool facilitating the methodology and the screening of EE projects is also developed, supporting financing bodies and EE funds to rapidly detect and aggregate projects that meet the necessary criteria to be financed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Business Process Management is a systematic way to design, implement and manage business critical processes at different organizational levels to ensure business sustainability. In this paper, we conduct a business process re-engineering exercise for KBK Securities Co., a small size security company operating in Iranian stock and mercantile market. The company suffered from in-efficiencies and poor and delayed decision-making due to poor visibility and complexity with business critical processes. Design: We employed a semi-quantitative approach using ELECTRE TRI decision-making method to identify the business critical processes. Through document analysis, we identified 103 financial and stock market processes to streamlining purposes. We use Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) and ELECTRE TRI methods for first, arriving to a consensus for the imprecise information elicited from a group of departmental managers, and second making a decision-making to determine the 32 business critical processes out of 103, and third clustering these processes for business process re-engineering. We make significant contribution in theory by employing a multi criterion decision-making (MCDM) in the financial sector in the context of a developing economy like Iran. Originality: We provide a structured framework along with an off the shelf software tool for practitioners to implement this approach to rationalize the number of processes and subsequently to improve the business critical processes to enhance financial performance in the stock market. Findings: Our findings suggest that company can cut down approximately 68% waste by reducing its business critical processes and spend their available time and resources in growing the business. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This study presents a novel hybrid entropy-clustering framework for placing pressure sensors in water distribution systems (WDS) to detect leakage. Leakages are simulated at all potential nodes of WDS, and then potential pressure sensors (PPS) in WDS are classified using a K-means clustering algorithm. Transinformation entropy for each potential pair of PPS was also computed, which in turn helped to reduce redundant information. PPS locations were subsequently optimized using a multi-objective optimization model. Furthermore, to capture the sensitivity of sensors' layout in WDS to sensor error, a fuzzy-based analysis is integrated with a multi-objective optimization model. Finally, the best compromise solution of PPS placement in each category was selected using an ELECTRE multi-criteria decision making model. Reducing redundant information of pressure sensors based on information theory and choosing the best possible solution based on the ELECTRE model are the main novelties of this study. Results of C-Town WDS attest to the proposed framework' efficiency. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={It is important to manage the oil wastes due to their chemical composition and the risks to human life. When the inappropriate management of such wastes causes environmental pollution and threatens all life, the importance of this issue becomes apparent. Landfill sites, in accordance with environmental laws, are among the management methods of oil wastes. The current study aimed to evaluate landfill site selection for solid drilling waste of Marun oilfield. An area with a 30 km radius was identified in the center of Marun oilfield for site selection based on environmental conditions and economic parameters. Effective parameters in the site selection process were determined and collected; then, the database of the collected data was prepared using GIS software. To implement the ordered weighted average method for site selection, the effective parameters as information layers were standardized using fuzzy logic and the relative weight of each of them was determined using the analytical hierarchy process. The limitations of each parameters were standardized using Boolean logic. Based on the sequential weights that calculated using the ordered weighted average method, seven scenarios were defined for determining the appropriate sites. Each scenario was classified into five classes of absolutely unsuitable, unsuitable, medium suitable, suitable, and absolutely suitable. Based on the characteristics of the oil wastes, the sites with absolutely suitable class in scenarios 6 and 7 were selected as proposed sites that include 6 sites and covers 3% of the total area of the studied range. The selected sites were prioritized using the ELECTRE method. The results showed that sites that are more suitable in terms of economic parameters, lithology features, and land use are given the highest priority. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, by combining the AHP, ELECTRE II, ELECTRE III, ELECTRE IV and Copeland techniques for road maintenance prioritization, in which the roads are evaluated and ranked based on various criteria. The proposed method is applied to four streets in Tehran, as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: First, a set of criteria for road maintenance was determined and their weights were obtained using the AHP method. Four streets in Tehran, Iran were considered as alternatives and prioritized using the ELECTRE II, ELECTRE III and ELECTRE IV methods. Finally, the results of employing the three methods were integrated using the Copeland method and a final result was obtained. Findings: The findings of the study suggested that “road safety” is the most important criterion in maintenance and “traffic volume” and “pavement quality index (PCI)” have the second and third rank in importance. Moreover, “The width of the street” is the least important criterion in road maintenance. Additionally, the streets' final ranking was obtained using the proposed method. Research limitations/implications: The proposed method helps managers effectively assign their limited budget and resources to roads with higher maintenance priority and as the result, increase the roads efficiency. Originality/value: In this research, eight main criteria were collected using previous researches and experts' opinions. Also, a new combination of different MCDM techniques is proposed in this research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The paper is focused on developing a rational paradigm of solving a joint decision problem of selecting a supplier and designing the supply chain/ logistic corridor. We consider the design of a logistic solution in developing, politically, and military sensitive regions. Thus, we analyse the supply chains that deliver goods (electrical cables) to Iraq. The decision problem involves the selection of suppliers combined with the intuitive/ heuristic design of transportation logistic corridors. This joint decision problem (suppliers' selection and logistics corridors design) is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem and solved with the application of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making/ Aiding (MCDM/A) methodology. Our approach is based on thorough analysis of the decision situation (internal and external conditions; decision makers, stakeholders; specific local constraints; existing expectations and preferences). We take into account the trade-offs and constraints (economic, political, social) to reach a compromise and most desirable solution. We carry out a series of computational experiments with the application of selected MCDM/A ranking methods, e.g. ELECTRE III/IV and AHP. We develop a universal decision model and adapt it to specific local circumstances and characteristic features of the applied decision tools, i.e. ELECTRE III/IV and AHP methods.

abstract={Water is considered as the most important component, but a limiting input, for agricultural production in Iran. In the context of water resources management, due to the limited availability of water and high cost of supplying it to the users, improvement of water use productivity has been regarded as one of the most appropriate approaches to manage water demand. Various tools have been applied for water management policy in the context of preventing high levels of water deficit. In the present study, different policy scenarios related to water supply management are assessed. These include estimation of the impacts of each policy scenario on physical and economic productivity indices and employment, using positive mathematical programming methods and maximum entropy. This methodology was applied to water use in the Qazvin Plain, Iran. Results suggested that application of these policy scenarios not only decreased water consumption but also generated desirable social and economic effects. Results of the ranking showed that the policy of imposing tax on input generated the best results for the study area. However, it is admitted that selection of the best policy scenario is dependent on the weight that policy makers would select for various indicators. © 2020, Tarbiat Modares University.

abstract={When exploiting groundwater, it is common to have problems with wells since maintenance activities can interrupt not only the production of water but also its distribution. Planning maintenance activities is a challenge that involves multiple agents, several criteria, and subjective variables. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision model based on a multicriteria approach to prioritize maintenance actions in the wells of a groundwater supply system. The proposed model considers different points of view and has three phases. The first phase consists of understanding the problem and acquiring data. Next, there is a learning process, during which Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA), a structuring method, is applied. The third phase uses the Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality, “ELECTRE III”) method to evaluate the problem. To determine criteria weights, Simos’ Procedure is used. The model is shown to have established management priorities that assist in making maintenance decisions.

abstract={The purpose of this paper reflects in a study of an optimal development path in the ELECTRE-based stepwise benchmarking context. In the paper, multi-criteria decision-making is first described as a tool for stepwise benchmarking, where the ELECTRE MLO ranking method is used. In order to make the problem of finding the optimal path easier and significantly reduce the number of the paths that have to be considered, we are proving the theorem showing that it is better to make gradual progress than “skip steps”. As an illustration of these considerations, the ELECTRE MLO method is applied to the benchmark teaching assistants of one faculty of Belgrade University, according to the marks given by their students. We are looking for an optimal development path by using our theorem that substantially reduces the number of cases. We are also checking that the paths with no steps skipped are superior to the paths in which steps are skipped, in accordance with the theoretical result we have obtained. Thus, we are demonstrating that one should first look up to the colleague who is a little better than him/her, and then gradually improve until he/she has reached the level of the individual given the best mark. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Advances in technology and an increase in the amount and complexity of data that are generated in healthcare have led to an indispensable revolution in this sector related to big data. Analytics of information based on multimodal clinical data sources requires big data projects. When starting big data projects in the healthcare sector, it is often necessary to assess the maturity of an organization with respect to big data, i.e., its capacity in managing big data. The assessment of the maturity of an organization requires multicriteria decision making as there is no single criterion or dimension that defines the maturity level regarding big data but an entire set of them. Based on the ISO 15504, this article proposes a fuzzy ELECTRE structure methodology to assess the maturity level of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the healthcare sector. The obtained experimental results provide evidence that this methodology helps to determine and compare maturity levels in big data management of organizations or the evolution of maturity over time. This is also useful in terms of diagnosing the readiness of an organization before starting to implement big data initiatives or technologies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

We compare the results with the weighted average to analyse the applicability of Electre III method in the Fog placement problem. We design a dynamical scenario in which new users appear along the simulation and we use the latency, hop count, cost, deployment penalty and energy consumption criteria to rank placement alternatives.

Hence, the determination of an optimal evacuation strategy is the key for improving the evacuation process efficiency when an emergency event happens. A group decision-making model based on triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) theory is developed for selecting an evacuation strategy in metro station. In this model, a group of experts elicit their preferences about the different evacuation strategies using TIFNs for multiple criteria. The Elimination Et Choice Translation Reality (ELECTRE) method is used to sort the different emergency evacuation strategies proposed for the metro station, and it should be adapted to manage TIFNs above all. The TIFN-ELECTRE model is proposed and applied to select the best emergency evacuation strategy of metro station. Finally, a numerical example with respect to the emergency evacuation strategy of Wuhan Guanggu Square station is carried out. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There are numerous and different ways to design an energy efficient street lighting system, but not always the best technical solution is the optimal economic solution as well. In this paper, we used two distinct software tools in order to obtain the optimal technical and economic solution for selecting street lighting technology. The first software used was DIALux, which is frequently applied in this field, assisting designers in choosing the most appropriate electrical installations and evaluating the technical performance of the chosen solutions. This tool determined the street lighting system variants for which there are predetermined configurations, so that the lighting parameters obtained are in accordance with the normative requirements of the lighting classes in which the roadways are included. Different ways of locating the luminaires and other parameters were changed to reach the best version that meets the qualitative requirements of the lighting technology. The second software used was the one developed by the authors, based on ELECTRE III method, which evaluated the technical solutions returned by DIALux against several criteria, taking into account the designer's preferences and constraints. The optimal technical and economic solution was obtained after ranking the variants by their performance at each criterion. The simulation experiment and the results returned suggested that the combination of the two software tools is comprehensive and effective and it can be used in this type of decisions at large scale. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

Our conclusions are supported by extensive computer experiments. The results underline the importance of (a) the number of reference actions and their distribution per category, (b) the number of criteria, and (c) the way in which the reference set is populated.

abstract={In traditional Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), risk priorities of failure modes are determined through the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a function of the three risk parameters Occurrence (O), Severity (S), and Detection (D). In the present paper, an alternative approach to RPN is proposed for the criticality assessment of system failure modes. Particularly, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method ELECTRE I is proposed to select the most critical failure mode in the set of the failure modes charactering a complex system. The method has been applied to a case study previously proposed by Zammori and Gabrielli (2012). © 2018},

abstract={This paper reports on an application of the VICA-ELECTRE TRI to a real world case study. We used the model VICA (Visual, Interactive and Comparative Analysis of individual opinions) to aid a cooperative group achieving a collective solution to a multicriteria sorting problem (student allocation to classes on a language school). Based on the individual results initially obtained, the model provides tools for the visualization of results and their comparison. It also points out means to seek or build a consensus on a solution, by guiding the changes of parameters and/or preference revisions in different possible ways of interaction between the members of the group. After a brief description of the model, we present the procedures followed, from the meeting plan to the case analysis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Uncertainty is an inherent characteristic of decision making related to sustainable construction projects. The main reason for this uncertainty is the incomplete information available to stakeholders on the relative impact of their decision criteria and the full consequences of the sustainability decisions on the projects' financial and environmental performance. One of the critical decisions made to achieve the objectives of sustainable construction projects is the choice of credits that qualify projects for certification by sustainability rating systems like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The objective of this paper is to create an objective methodology for the sustainability credit selection along with a modeling tool that incorporates the proposed methodology and then compare the performance of this tool with that of the commonly used cognitive approaches to decision making. Therefore, structured interviews were held with industry professionals, the results of which are used to develop an ordered-probit statistical model that identifies the significant independent parameters affecting the subject credit-selection decisions. Subsequently, the proposed credit-selection methodology is developed based on the ELECTRE III technique and compared with the intuition-based approach. The validation of the model results is performed by comparing the model output with credits actually selected in a number of actual projects targeting certification by LEED and the Qatar Sustainability Rating System (QSAS). The results of this comparison indicate that the developed methodology is capable of providing valuable guidance in the credit-selection process in the early stage of project design. The methodology also provides a systematic and consistent way for credit selection based on in-depth analyses of the evaluation criteria and perceived project priorities. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The supplier selection problem represents one of the most important components of the supply chain management. This article presents a multiple criteria decision making analysis contributing to the selection of the most convenient supplier in the flexible packaging industry. Due to the fact that in today's supply chain management, the performance of potential suppliers is evaluated against multiple criteria rather than taking into account only the cost factor, the appropriate criteria in the supplier selection have been identified, and the considered variants are assessed, considering the decision maker's preferences and existing constraints. The variants are ranked in terms of their suitability for selecting a supplier with the use of Electre III method. The results obtained from the simulation experiment suggest that this methodology is a feasible decision support model. © 2017 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Task scheduling is an interesting topic in cloud computing nowadays. The mapping of the cloud resources to process the customer requests is very challenging and a well-known NP-Complete problem. In this paper, we address this problem with the consideration of the priority as one of the critical issues in the task scheduling process. The priority is computed according to the most important parameters that can meet user’s requirements and improve the resource utilization. We propose a new Dynamic Priority-Queue (DPQ) approach based on a hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) namely ELECTRE III and Differential Evolution (DE). Furthermore, to schedule the tasks, we introduce a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing (SA). The proposed DEELDPQ-SAPSO approach has been validated through the CloudSim simulator. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve good performance, user priority, load balancing and improve the resource utilization. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new scientific decision framework (SDF) under interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment for supplier selection (SS). The framework consists of two phases, where, in the first phase, criteria weights are estimated in a sensible manner using newly proposed IVIF based statistical variance (SV) method and, in the second phase, the suitable supplier is selected using ELECTRE (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) ranking method under IVIF environment. This method involves three categories of outranking, namely, strong, moderate, and weak. Previous studies on ELECTRE ranking reveal that scholars have only used two categories of outranking, namely, strong and weak, in the formulation of IVIF based ELECTRE, which eventually aggravates fuzziness and vagueness in decision making process due to the potential loss of information. Motivated by this challenge, third outranking category, called moderate, is proposed, which considerably reduces the loss of information by improving checks to the concordance and discordance matrices. Thus, in this paper, IVIF-ELECTRE (IVIFE) method is presented and popular TOPSIS method is integrated with IVIFE for obtaining a linear ranking. Finally, the practicality of the proposed framework is demonstrated using SS example and the strength of proposed SDF is realized by comparing the framework with other similar methods. © 2017 R.

abstract={The aim of this study is to compare the potential environmental impacts of three kinds of aluminum: primary aluminum ingot (A), secondary aluminum ingot (B) and to mix aluminum ingot (C) with each other. For this purpose, the life cycle assessment model is developed based on damage – oriented approach. For each unit process, the reference flow is 500 kg. The results show that model “A” has the highest impacts in all categories, model “B” is intermediate and the model “B” is the most environmentally friendly process. As a surprising result model “B” has the highest amount for fluoride, BTEX and VOC compared with the models ”A” and “C” as air emission. Finally with regard to all aspects, model “B” or mixed aluminum is selected as the preferable option. The most important reasons for this selection are energy savings, low refining required and low demand for specially landfill operation with regarding Iran as a developing country. Also we examine further this subject by applying the Entropy and ELECTRE methods. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

The case study considered green roofs, rain gardens, rain barrels and pervious pavement over a range of economic, social, and water quality and quantity criteria by applying 4 MCDA methods under three different stakeholder views. The results indicated Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Réalité (ELECTRE) III to be the most appropriate method for the methodology, presenting flexibility concerning threshold values, criteria weights, and showing shared top choices across stakeholders (rain gardens, and rain gardens in combination with pervious pavement).

abstract={The implementation of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) could help re-establish the natural hydrological cycle of watersheds after urbanization, with each BMP presenting a different performance across a range of criteria (flood prevention, pollutant removal, etc.). Additionally, conflicting views from the relevant stakeholders may arise, resulting in a complex selection process. This paper proposes a methodology for BMP selection based on the application of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods, integrating multiple stakeholder priorities and BMP combinations. First, in the problem definition, the MCDA methods, relevant criteria and design guidelines are selected. Next, information from the preliminary analysis of the watershed is used to obtain a list of relevant BMPs. The third step comprises the watershed modeling and analysis of the BMP alternatives to obtain performance values across purely objective criteria. Afterwards, a stakeholder analysis based on survey applications is carried out to obtain social performance values and criteria priorities. Then, the MCDA methods are applied to obtain the final BMP rankings. The last step considers the sensitivity analysis and rank comparisons in order to draw the final conclusions and recommendations. Future improvements to the methodology could explore inclusion of multiple objective analysis, and alternative means for obtaining social performance values. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={The performance evaluation of competencies is one of the most promising tools for assessing human capital in organizations. However, the analysis of multiple axes at the same time is complex and prone to error. The aim of this study is to propose the use of multicriteria support to aid the decision maker in evaluating competencies. To this end, the multicriteria method called ELECTRE TRI was used to analyze the competencies and accomplish classification of the employees. The competencies axes, Skills, Knowledge and Attitude (SKA) are used in the method as criteria while the evaluated employees were the "alternatives". A field study involving 91 employees working in Call Center Company of Pernambuco State (Brazil) was conducted. The results showed that it is possible to perform specific modeling for each type of function. In the groups of attendants, approximately 15% of workers demonstrated poor performance. Analogously, similar results were observed in 10% of managers. The model arises as a support in the processes of firing, hiring and training. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

abstract={At present, distributed group decision-making processes are common practice in networked and information-based organisations. Consequently, an adequate coordination of the activities in a multicriteria group decision process is required to ensure the success of these complicated processes.

This paper presents the implementation of parallel and sequential coordination methods in a web-based multicriteria group decision support system. We subsequently present an empirical study of the influence of these two coordination methods on the actuation of a collaborative group decision process and the final consensual solution in the context of distributed multicriteria group decision analysis, which represent the loosest and tightest task interdependence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The progress of information and communication technologies (ICT) has promoted the development of healthcare which has enabled the exchange of resources and services between organizations. Organizations want to integrate mobile devices into their hospital information systems (HIS) due to the convenience to employees who are then able to perform specific healthcare processes from any location. The collection and merage of healthcare data from discrete mobile devices are worth exploring possible ways for further use, especially in remote districts without public data network (PDN) to connect the HIS. In this study, we propose an optimal mobile service which automatically synchronizes the telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. The proposed service enforces some technical methods. The role-based access control model defines the telecare file resources accessing mechanism; the symmetric data encryption method protects telecare file resources transmitted over a mobile peer-to-peer network. The multi-criteria decision analysis method, ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality), evaluates multiple criteria of the candidates’ mobile devices to determine a ranking order. This optimizes the synchronization of telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. A prototype system is implemented to examine the proposed mobile service. The results of the experiment show that the proposed mobile service can automatically and effectively synchronize telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. The contribution of this experiment is to provide an optimal mobile service that enhances the security of telecare file resource synchronization and strengthens an organization’s mobility. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is the application of a tool to assist themulti-criteria decision-making process for selecting an asset for a company in the metallurgical industry which manufactures metal parts for diverse industries. Design/methodology/approach – This investment, complex due to the commitment of resources it requires, has been made with the assistance of decision-making methodologies, specifically versions I and IV of the ELECTRE method. Findings – This model of multi-criteria decision making has been chosen over other models because it offers the possibility of including technical and economic decisions so they can be analyzed simultaneously, therefore the decision is not based solely on financial aspects. Many companies base their decisions exclusively on financial returns, however in this case it is also appropriate to include the technical parameters, since the asset being replaced is the most important asset of the company. Originality/value – Applying version I of the methodology, the optimal technical configuration of the asset will be analyzed based on the features requirements, all of which are among options available in the market. Once a subset of technically and economically viable alternatives has been defined, version IV will be applied and a ranking of the alternatives from the best to the worst will be obtained and, based on this ranking, the final decision will be made. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={For entrepreneurs, decision making is present right from the start. The decision-making process in business has received extensive academic attention in recent decades. One of the first-order strategic decisions for an entrepreneur is where to locate the new business. The emergence of the multi-criteria decision analysis paradigm allowed several criteria to be considered when making a decision, which surpassed the previous single criterion decision paradigm. The Electre methodology pioneered this new paradigm and, among the evolutions of the Electre method, version IV is perhaps the least used. This paper aims to show a methodology to aid decision making for entrepreneurs, in particular the location decision. Thus, this study shows an example, an empirical application of Electre IV for locating a business, with the ultimate goal of providing companies with a ranking of alternatives to consider, such that it provides a competitive advantage if the choice agrees with the first positions of the final ranking. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this study, selected MCDM methods' outranking process will be used to outrank the military tanks. PROMETHEE II (the preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluation) outranking method has been introduced to help a decision maker (DM) for outranking the military tanks which are evaluated on several criteria. In addition to PROMETHEE II method, ELECTRE III (elimination et choix traduisant la realite - elimination) method is also examined and applied to military tanks for outranking.

abstract={In this article we propose a method for information retrieval based on relational Multi-Criteria Decision Making. We assume that a user cannot define precise search criteria so that these criteria must be found based on the users assessment of several sample alternatives (alternatives here are database records, e.g. images). This situation is common in Content-based Image Retrieval, where it is easier for a user to indicate relevant images than to describe a proper query, especially in formal language. The proposed algorithm for the elicitation of criteria is based on ELECTRE III-A method originally designed for ranking a set of alternatives according to defined criteria. In our algorithm, however, the direction of reasoning is reversed: we start with several sample alternatives that have been assigned a rank by the user and then we select criteria that are compatible (in the sense of ELECTRE methodology) with the users preferences expressed on a sample set. Then, having determined the users criteria, we apply classical ELECTRE III to retrieve the relevant solutions from the database. We implemented the method in Matlab and tested it on the Microsoft Cambridge Image Database. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Various software tools implementing multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have appeared over the last decades. Although MCDA methods share common features, most of the implementing software have been developed independently from scratch. Majority of the tools have a proprietary storage format and exchanging data among software is cumbersome. Common data exchange standard would be useful for an analyst wanting to apply different methods on the same problem. The Decision Deck project has proposed to build components implementing MCDA methods in a reusable and interchangeable manner. A key element in this scheme is the XMCDA standard, a proposal that aims to standardize an XML encoding of common structures appearing in MCDA models, such as criteria and performance evaluations. Although XMCDA allows to present most data structures for MCDA models, it almost completely lacks data integrity checks. In this paper we present a new comprehensive data model for MCDA problems, implemented as an XML schema.

abstract={ISO/IEC 20000: 2011 and ITIL v3 provide reference process management strategy for IT service practice. However, because of the variety of IT services, process management is difficult to establish an accurate quantitative process model. Since the core of IT service quantitative management is managing processes quantitatively, it is necessary to establish a quantitative model for process management. However, excessive metrics in process model have increased the complexity and uncertainty of the model. In this paper, real data is measured and collected to establish measurement model set, and ELECTRE III method is used for model decision. Experiment shows that ELECTRE method can meet the decision needs of enterprises for multi-attribute objectives, and the model decision result has a fairly high goodness-of-fit score. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last decade the interest for electric production using PhotoVoltaic System (PVS) has strongly increased; namely for the citizen who is able to use roofs or personal surfaces to put in place such systems. For instance, the installed residential PVS capacity has grown to 550 MW (Megawatt) in metropolitan France during the last years. The same trend can be noticed in many developed countries at the same time. However, in light of this investment, people would like to be informed of the different aspects, especially the economic and environmental ones, in order to make their choice. In this sense, this paper deals with the decision-making problem for the residential PVS investment. Different alternatives of module surfaces and PV technology installation are considered and a procedure founded on the ELECTRE approach to aid the citizen in his choice is proposed. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

The originality of this study is to take account of the tyre camber angle within the range (+/-20°) in the robust design of a vehicle suspension system. The methodology is based on the hierarchical organisation of the design process, on simplified models, on sensitivity analysis and on robust optimisation. The paper describes the robust design methods, the modelling of the tyre, the design process and the results. Two models of car tyres valid for high camber angles have been defined. The design strategy based on 'First Design' and 'Rational Design' methods, as well as on the 'Electre' decision-support method, shows its strong potential for finding efficient and robust solutions. The feasibility of integrating an axle into the steering system at high camber angles is demonstrated. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Therefore, a multi-attribute decision model is obtained based on risk preference theory. Moreover, the weight is decided by Least Squares Combination method and results can be worked out by ELECTRE-II model; finally, the model is tested by empirical studies of freight transportation mode choice for container, coal and ore cargo from Chongqing to Shanghai. Different consignors may adopt diverse modes of transport due to their own risk preferences.

abstract={Evaluating and comparing the threats and vulnerabilities associated with territorial zones according to multiple criteria (industrial activity, population, etc.) can be a time-consuming task and often requires the participation of several experts and decision makers. Rather than a direct evaluation of these zones, building a risk evaluation scale and using it in a formal procedure permits to automate the assessment and therefore to apply it in a repeated way and in large-scale contexts and, provided the chosen procedure and scale are accepted, to make it objective. One of the main difficulty of building such a formal evaluation procedure is to account for the multiple experts knowledge and decision makers preferences. The procedure used in this article, ELECTRE TRI, uses the performances of each territorial zone onmultiple criteria, together with preferential parameters, to qualitatively assess their associated risk level. The preferential parameters to be determined are the category limits, i.e. the limits on each criterion of the performance range associated with a given risk level, and the weights associated with the different criteria. To obtain these parameters with no direct questioning of the stakeholders, tools based on mathematical programming have been developed to deduce these preferential parameters from assessment examples. In this article, several such tools are applied together in order to build a complete example leading to the definition of a territorial risk evaluation scale taking into account the preferences of multiple stakeholders. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Recent years have seen a progressive spread of ontologies. This indicates the need for instruments for their evaluation and ranking. However, most of the developed algorithms are based on a single metric, thus focusing on a unique feature and neglecting other potentially meaningful aspects. Others perform a weighted aggregation of different metrics, thus resulting in poor tunability and sensitivity to measurement errors. In this context, we propose the adoption of general purpose and flexible multi-criteria decision analysis techniques which represent a total novelty for ontologies. Two methods belonging to the Electre family are presented: Electre I and Electre III. Both techniques are compared to the well-known AKTiveRank procedure, demonstrating their suitability for ontology ranking. The former best identifies the most promising candidates amongst a set of alternatives. The latter provides a set of tuning parameters for making thin ranking procedures.

abstract={Hydrogen demand has already significantly increased due to the industry needs. Mature technologies based on fossil fuels are not satisfactory due to greenhouse gas concerns. In response, a range of advanced processes are being developed throughout the world. Within the 'International Energy Agency - Hydrogen Implementing Agreement - Task 25', a multicriteria methodology was developed for the evaluation of high temperature hydrogen production processes. The aim is to guide R&D strategy by highlighting to which extent the processes may appear promising. The method that was developed is based on the elimination and choice translating the reality (ELECTRE). This study has conducted a first pass application to hydrogen production and highlights the importance of significant weightings and discriminating criteria. Decision makers can apply this method to extract their own subset of processes from the alternatives, according to their system of values defined through the selection of criteria and the associated weights.

abstract={A new approach for using the preferences elicited from a Decision Maker (DM) into the operational framework of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is presented. The preference representation is achieved using the parameters and principles of the ELECTRE TRI method devoted to the sorting problem. The outranking relation is used to replace the non-dominance relation in the usual operators in the EA (crossover, mutation and selection operator). The aim of this approach is to focus the search on the region of interest defined by the DM's preferences and consequently restrict the number of solutions in the Pareto-optimal front to be subject to further screening. This aspect is particularly important when dealing with problems that lead to a large number of non-dominated solutions. ©2010 IEEE.},

The four-step dissimilarity measure introduces an alternative and more accurate way of assigning objects to clusters. In particular, it compares each object with each mode, for every attribute that they have in common, and then chooses the most appropriate mode and its corresponding cluster for that object. Seven widely used data sets are tested to verify the robustness of the proposed method in six clustering evaluation measures.Journal of the Operational Research Society (2009) 60, 1085-1095. doi:10.1057/jors.2009.25; published online 29 April 2009 © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

Among different mathematical methods to aid to making decisions, the Multicriteria Decision Making Methods (MCDM) have been the most useful. Following the theoretical and practical studies 9 criteria were considered relevant to set a Decision Matrix for this application. A local team and different cartels were established in the country to determine for these criteria the weights and the values for each alternative. Three MCDM Methods, ELECTRE-I, PROMETHEE and A.H.P. have been performed. The robustness of the results were demonstrated by means of sensibility analysis. Using the three methods the second alternative was preferred. That has established a methodology and a method to aid to making decision in this actual problem.},

abstract={Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problem is a management science technique, which is popularly used to rank the priority of alternatives with respect to their competing attributes. It is popularly used in diverse fields such as engineering management, portfolio selection, transportation planning, and performance evaluation. Weights form the core of MADM: it is obvious that different weights lead to various evaluation results and decisions. Several approaches have been developed for assessing the weights of MADM problems, e.g., the eigenvector method, ELECTRE, and TOPSIS. However, an assessment approach of weights in MADM, which meets both the need of simplicity interface for practitioners and concrete theory for scholars is not easy, and balancing these two aspects is a challenging and tough task. Since the pay-off matrix in game theory could be regarded as a simple interface for data input/output, and very few scholars had ever explored the two-person zero-sum game on MADM problems. In this paper, the weights of a MADM problem are obtained by formulating it as a two-person zero-sum game with multiple decision makers. The group equilibrium solution, i.e., consensus of weights and the resolution steps for such a group MADM game has also been originally developed and validated in this study. Finally, an actual case of selecting the appropriate portfolio decision for a paper company is illustrated. © World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.},

Emphasis is placed on simple configuration testing enabling validation of the physical modeling within non Equilibrium Navier Stokes codes. The facilities used are the ONERA hot shot F4, the DLR Stalker tube HEG, and the RWTH Aachen shock tube TH2. The simple configurations are the Nozzle, the Electre blunt cone, the hyperboloid flare, and the 70 degree blunt cone. In addition to these axisymmetric configurations, the Halis/Orbiter configuration was extensively tested and numerically computed to validate the ground to flight extrapolation methodology. Real gas effects on aerodynamic forces and in particular on pitching moment for the ARD Apollo shape and Halis have been reproduced in the F4 and compared to flight. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for additional improvements in nozzle calibrations using non-intrusive methods and for an increased use of CFD for the design of experiments, the definition of the test environment, the interpretation of the results and finally the extrapolation to flight. © 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

abstract={A new approach for ecological restoration of floodplains of regulated rivers is presented. The emphasis is laid on restoring the most important abiotic factor, the water regime, which has undergone serious deteriorations due to anthropogeneous effects. The idea is to change the water regime on the floodplain for the benefit of ecology, by controlling the flow in the links connecting the floodplain depressions to the river and to each other. The viability of this approach is proven on a case study dealing with the restoration of a Danube floodplain. The flow control is proposed to be implemented on a passive way, by appropriately sizing the connecting channels and weirs of the floodplain. Accordingly, several restoration alternatives have been set up, evaluated and compared to each other. The evaluation is based on known relationships among ecology, hydrology and water quality. For the hydrological and water quality analysis, simulation models have been used. The comparison of alternatives is done by the ELECTRE II multi-criteria decision support technique. © 1995.},

abstract={Health systems are complex organisations that attempt to deliver health services to meet the needs of the population. Regardless of the degree of access to and quality of those health services, the systems' sustainability has been the object of special attention by governments worldwide. To ensure their adequate functioning in light of the accountable and transparent facets of New Public Governance, one must resort to regulatory mechanisms, such as sunshine regulation. By publicly displaying the results of benchmarking assessments, sunshine regulation “embarrasses” operators with poor performances in an effort to force them to correct such divergences. Thus, in this paper, we propose a sunshine regulatory model to the public hospitals in Portugal using multi-criteria decision analysis. In particular, we created a five-star rating that categorises those operators according to their performances, by means of the outranking method ELECTRE TRI-NC. As a result, we provide evidence of the existence of a majority of providers assigned to the ‘Average’ category of “Three stars” and the nonexistence of providers with unique extreme category assignments (“One star” or “Five stars”), both of which are supported by extensive stability and robustness analyses, and discussed in terms of policy implications for relevant stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nowadays, modeling tools are a crucial part of best practice in the elaboration and implementation of a decarbonization plan in any organization, city, or country. The present review analyzes the different modeling tools available to assess energy systems in smart cities. It creates an updated overview of the modeling tools currently available, showing their capabilities and main potential outputs when considering the energy efficiency objective in the context of smart cities in Europe. A restricted set of 14 tools are identified which optimally fulfill the modeling mission of the energy sector, in a smart city context, for different time horizons. The selection considers the capability to include decarbonization assessments, namely, by considering the flexibility to use different external factors, energy policies, technologies, and mainly the implementation of Article 7 from the Energy Efficiency Directive and the “energy efficiency first” principle defined by the European Commission. The ELECTRE TRI method was used to implement a multi-criteria decision approach for sorting modeling tools, aiming at distributing the various alternatives by previously defined categories, and considering the performance criteria of each alternative modeling tool, the analysis suggests that the best options are the LEAP, MESSAGEix, and oemof tools. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Multidimensional risk assessment for natural gas pipelines has proved to be an efficient approach for companies to evaluate multiple risk perspectives and to determine different mitigation actions. Therefore, making decisions to ensure the system's best performance, taking into account safety issues, is a challenging task. This paper proposes a multidimensional risk classification with global sensitivity analysis by making a structured analysis of uncertainty that uses a Monte Carlo Simulation and visualization tools. For this analysis, five scenarios of a group of parameters are set according to operational and technical issues, consequences and the preferential properties of the model for pipeline sections. Then, sensitivity levels are statistically validated and defined for each section, thereby generating information on modifications to the classification of levels of risk. For example, 10% variation in the group of parameters related to the Critical Danger Radius (CDR), 6 out of 8 pipeline sections present high sensitivity levels; showing that their original risk classifications do not remain the same. Also, 4 sections are expected to be in the high risk class, while 1 section is expected to be in medium class and 3 sections in the low risk class. Consequently, managers should prioritize mitigation strategies to those sections with significant risk categories The advantages of our proposals are twofold. First, the proposed methodology enables decisions to be made on classifying risks which incorporate evidence on the sensitivity and uncertainties of natural gas pipelines. Secondly, effective information on classifying risk is provided to the decision-maker by using statistical validations and visualization tools. Thus, managers can enhance their perception of risks with regard to a natural gas pipeline, can generate insights to control mitigations and allocate resources to ensure safety for people, and can avoid losses regarding the environment and their companies' properties. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This article is concerned to delineate the strategic approach of ELiminating Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) method for multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) in terms of complex spherical fuzzy sets. The feasible, well-suited, and marvelous structure of complex spherical fuzzy set compliments the decision-making efficiency and ranking calibre of ELECTRE I approach to present a beneficial and supreme aptitude strategy for MAGDM. Beside the proposed methodology, a few non-fundamental properties of complex spherical fuzzy weighted averaging (CSFWA) operator inclusive of shift invariance, homogenous, linearity, and additive property are also explored. The proposed procedure validates the individual opinions into an acceptable form by the dint of CSFWA operator and the aggregated opinions are further analyzed by the proposed complex spherical fuzzy- ELECTRE I (CSF-ELECTRE I) method. Within the consideration of proposed methodology, normalized Euclidean distances of complex spherical fuzzy numbers are also contemplated. In CSF-ELECTRE I method, the score, accuracy, and refusal degrees determine the concordance and discordance sets for each pair of alternatives to calculate the concordance and discordance indices, respectively. Based on aggregated outranking matrix, a decision graph is constructed to attain the ELECTREcally outranked solutions and the best alternative. This article provides supplementary approach at the final step to profess a linear ranking order of the alternatives. The versatility and feasibility of the presented method are embellished with two case studies from the business and IT field.

abstract={We consider multiple criteria sorting problems with preference-ordered classes delimited by a set of boundary profiles. While significantly extending the ELECTRE Tri-B method, we present an integrated framework for modeling indirect preference information and conducting robustness analysis. We allow the Decision Maker (DM) to provide the following three types of holistic judgments: assignment examples, assignment-based pairwise comparisons, and desired class cardinalities. A diversity of recommendation that can be obtained given the plurality of outranking-based sorting models compatible with the DM’s preferences is quantified by means of six types of results. These include possible assignments, class acceptability indices, necessary assignment-based preference relation, assignment-based outranking indices, extreme class cardinalities, and class cardinality indices. We discuss the impact of preference information on the derived outcomes, the interrelations between the exact results computed with mathematical programming and stochastic indices estimated with the Monte Carlo simulations, and new measures for quantifying the robustness of results. The practical usefulness of the approach is illustrated on data from the Financial Times concerning MBA programs. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Integrating these kinds of systems with business processes in the most efficient way requires to endeavour as much as possible simplifications for final users, which can be pursued by optimizing crucial software characteristics. The present article proposes a novel Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to deal with such an issue. Specifically, the ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) TRI technique is suggested to assign ERP modules into predefined and ordered categories according to maintainability and usability, which are useful drivers in evaluating which module of an ERP software should be enhanced with priority. The results prove to have whole beneficial impact on system performance with relation to a case study: improvement evaluations will be identified based on the classes the ERP modules are assigned to by the method. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new framework that integrates two fuzzy group decision making approaches including TOPSIS and ELECTRE II. The main objective of this combination is to improve the outcomes provided by these methods through increasing the differentiation between the alternatives in fuzzy TOPSIS and decreasing the incomparability between the alternatives in fuzzy ELECTRE. In addition, to more precisely compute the criteria weights, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated model (CCSD) are used. This research has been inspired from a real case study in lithium extraction processes. Due to the quite limited mineral resources of lithium and the global efforts to replace a clean and recyclable energy instead of fossil fuels, the challenge for lithium extraction from other resources such as brines and seawater has been increased significantly. The proposed framework helps to select the most suitable process of lithium extraction from brines and seawater based on a complex multi-criteria decision making. In view of the fact that efficiency of the decision-making procedures is significantly depends on the stability of the solution, the sensitivity analysis is performed. The performance and capabilities of the proposed framework are appraised by comparing its results with some existing fuzzy MCDM methods through five lithium extraction processes from brines and seawater, as a case study. The results of the analysis indicate the rationality and enforceability of the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Improvement Performance Appraisal of the Civil Servant (CS) is important in the field of Human Resource Development. Currently, conventional performance appraisal is still used even though it cannot provide an objective assessment. CS performance is important so it needs to be properly assessed. CS performance is influenced by working behavior and competence. Various methods have been carried out to improve the competence of CS. In this case, more directed to a formal way, Self-Development is less emphasized on each individual CS itself. Therefore, in this research, Profile Matching and ELECTRE method is recommended to measure the value of criteria weighting on CS Self-Development. Input from this Profile Matching are questioner data in the form of interest and talent ability from CS. Then the suitable measurement is used to determine the weight criteria using ELECTRE. Thus, the ELECTRE method will be used to calculate the values that have been obtained and adjusted to the existing rules. The output of this information system is a data list of recommendations for field competencies that can be selected by CS. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approaches have been investigated extensively for ranking the alternatives related to multiple attributes. In most existing MADM approaches, attribute weights play a key role due to the fact that the ranking of alternatives may changes with attribute weights vector. Ranking range can be used to measure the lower and upper bounds of all possible rankings of alternatives when attribute weights are varying. In the paper, we investigate the ranking range for the selected seven popular MADM approaches: Weighted averaging (WA), weighted geometric averaging (WGA), ordered weighted averaging (OWA), ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA), TOPSIS, PROMETHEE and ELECTRE. Through determining the ranking ranges of alternatives, associated with attribute weights, in the selected seven approaches, we present several desirable properties of the ranking range. Then, we design the simulation experiments with either random or real data to compare the ranking range for selected seven MADM approaches. Interestingly, the experiment results clearly show that TOPSIS≻ELECTRE≻PROMETHEE~WA≻WGA≻OWA≻OWGA in the average sense, where '≻' denotes the larger ranking range, and '~' denotes no difference in the ranking range. A larger ranking range means an easier to manipulate the ranking of alternatives, and also means a worse robustness of a MADM approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Because that the crime in a wide way impacts the life of the people in the big metropolis, researchers have treated the question from several angles. The purpose of the paper, under the umbrella of operational research, is to develop a model of the ordering of police strategies, in the fight against crime in general, according to a certain criminal demand. Design/methodology/approach: For the construction of the impact matrix of the strategies under the reduction of crime rates, considering a portfolio of crimes, a questionnaire applied to specialists was used. In a second moment, defined the criteria and strategies to be ordered, the multicriteria ELECTRE IV method was used, which with the help of the J-Electre software emulated the systematized data in the impact matrix and produced the final ordering of the most efficient strategies, in the fight against crime, in the perception of decision-makers. Findings: As a result, the research revealed that policing strategies directed at solving specific crimes are the most effective in the perception of decision-makers after the emulation of data with the ELECTRE IV method. Research limitations/implications: As research implications, it can be inferred that the use of multicriteria methods in the modeling of problems in the area of public security can contribute to rationalization of the use of the means available in the fight against crime in large cities. The research showed that it is possible to use customized policing strategies to a certain reality. Practical implications: The method presented in this research is directly related to the major strategies: problem-oriented policing and hot spot policing. This method allows public safety managers to consider the possibility of combining different law enforcement strategies in each context. In this sense, the use of the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) (ELECTRE IV) method allows the evaluation of a large set of alternatives according to a set of established criteria, speeding up the process and reducing subjectivity, allowing the manager to analyze several scenarios with greater clarity and impartiality and choosing an alternative that best solves the proposed problem. The expected result is the rationalization of the available means applied in the search for the reduction of crime rates. Social implications: The customization of policing strategies, according to criminal demands, implies the efficient way to reduce criminal charges. Reducing criminal rates enables the development of the local economy, tourism and the quality of life of people by exercising their freedom to the full. Originality/value: The originality lies in filling a gap in the literature with the elaboration of the impact matrix of policing strategies in reducing criminal indices, and in their associated use in ordering strategies through a multicriteria method. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Urban development planning is the process of developing long-range policies for the future of a region, taking into consideration technical, political, social and environmental aspects. The need to incorporate the prementioned aspects, resulted in the increasing use of multicriteria approaches. One of the most common problems of urban development planning is to choose among various alternative projects. Motivated by the sustainable utilization of Athens’ Hellinikon airport, this paper proposes a methodology for the selection of the best solution for the development of the urban site under certain preconditions. The main purpose of this multicriteria methodology is to assess five alternative investment proposals for the development of the urban site. Since local policy makers are considered to be the stakeholders, the implemented evaluation method includes several criteria that are based on three main categories: economy, environment and society. The selected criteria represent relevant, controllable and measurable elements and could be used as sustainable development indicators. A questionnaire is designed to gather information from stakeholders to evaluate the degree of influence of each indicator on the selection of the proposals. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out giving different preferences from the stakeholders. This paper offers an evaluation framework based on a blend of three types of approaches, the additive value model, the Electre III and the Promethee II. The three methods have been developed in the past, however, this paper tries to offer a cohesive framework, which can be used for the evaluation of urban development proposals in the light of economic, environmental and social criteria. The results obtained by the multicriteria evaluation method showed that the alternative proposals including the exploitation of the examined region in all land uses, marked the best performances in almost all the criteria. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Defects of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) manifest in actual decision-making process, so adding probabilities to the values in HFS is necessary. The probabilistic HFS (PHFS) is a useful tool to describe the uncertainty of elements in HFS by introducing occurrence probabilities. However, some important issues in PHFS utilization remain to be addressed. In this study, an outranking method for multicriteria decision making (MCDM) with probabilistic hesitant information is presented. First, the binary relations between two probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements (PHFEs) are defined on the basis of the elimination and choice translating reality method. Some outranking relations between the alternatives are then introduced. Second, we provide a Hausdorff distance between two PHFEs. The main characteristic of the proposed Hausdorff distance is that it does not require the same length and arrangement of the PHFEs. Third, a maximizing Hausdorff distance deviation method is developed to obtain the evaluation criteria weights under a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, an illustrative example in conjunction with comparative analysis is used to demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible for practical MCDM problems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Terrorist network may be defined as collection of suspected terrorist nodes which may function in disguise towards accomplishing a terrorist activity. They use extensive communication channel for sharing crucial information. Terrorist network analysis is highly efficacious for intelligence analysis and deriving useful conclusions from available data. Computer Science and Network analysis act as pertinent fields for the study and graphical interpretation of these networks. In this paper, we examine the 26/11 Mumbai attack terrorist network dataset and employ the ELECTRE method for identification of key node in the terrorist network. ELECTRE is an effective multi-criteria decision-making model. It provides a framework for structuring a decision problem integrates the quantitative and qualitative factors of the problem and facilitates easy computation. From the 26/11 Mumbai attack dataset of terrorist network, we have determined that out of several terrorists in the network "Wassi" was the momentous and mastermind of all. The proposed work also demonstrates improvement of result in terms of concurrence, generalization accuracy and genuineness. Based on the solution of ELECTRE framework, it is resolved that the obtained (terrorist) nodes will step up the work of law enforcement agencies and enable them to confine their focus on important members of the terrorist network. Identification of key terrorist is highly important for developing long-term strategies to counter forthcoming terrorist attacks. It can be better implemented during the development of smart city especially for India. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Continual introduction of new materials and improvements in existing materials increase the variety of materials that can be used for pressure vessel components. Among wide variety of materials, the most suitable one must be selected for a component by matching its functional requirements with various available materials’ specifications. This study proposes an interactive knowledge-based decision support system for selecting the most suitable material for a given pressure vessel component and its working environment. The developed decision support system, namely Pressure Vessel SELection (PVSEL), consists of two separate phases. In the first elimination phase of PVSEL, the user obtains a feasible set of alternative materials by answering various questions and providing lower-limit values at materials’ critical specifications. PVSEL, then, uses a ranking phase which uses ELECTRE, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods to rank the feasible materials. In the second phase, each alternative material’s ranking is determined by combining its performance values at weighted critical specifications (selection criteria), which are considered as important in meeting the functional requirements of the component. Usage of PVSEL is illustrated in the paper and the results show that the proposed PVSEL is an effective selection tool and provides meaningful results for the designers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The non-centrifugal sugar (NCS) industry is one of the oldest small-scale cottage industry in India, whose technological features are not changed for several decades due to which the production and consumption of NCS has reduced significantly. One way to attend this problem is to select the best and sustainable methods among the existing technologies at various stages in the production process. In the production of NCS, juice extraction is the primary and essential process. The present work gives an insight to a logical procedure for selecting a suitable and sustainable juice extraction method for improving the NCS production using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique. The selection process is based on 11 evaluation criteria covering various sustainable factors viz. technological, economic and environmental factors. Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) integrated with elimination et choix traduisant la realité method is the MCE technique considered for selecting the most appropriate crushing method among five alternatives. The results indicated that the power-operated single horizontal crusher is the most suitable and sustainable crushing method for improving the production rate of NCS. The same technique can be used for the other process unit of the NCS production to improve the productivity and sustainability of NCS. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={The commercial real estate (CRE) sector concerns a diverse set of actors that specialize in real estate activities, such as brokerage, valuation, construction, and asset management. CRE activity is a key indicator for the level of corporate growth and the economic development of a country. However, investments in CRE face a volatile global environment, which is characterized by deep uncertainties and cyclical behavior. In this context, decision support tools that facilitate the monitoring and assessment of CRE investments are of major importance for various stakeholders, including investors and policy makers. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive approach for assessing CRE investments based on a multicriteria evaluation framework. The analysis is based on a sample of commercial assets taken from the portfolio of a real estate investment company in the United States. The proposed multicriteria approach considers a rich set of evaluation criteria, including macroeconomic indicators, information about the local CRE markets, as well as the characteristics of the assets under consideration. Using analytical methodologies from the family of ELECTRE outranking methods, the assets are ranked and rated according to their overall performance. Different scenarios are explored for the weightings of the appraisal criteria, thus enabling the analysis of the robustness of the results. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={A multicriteria methodology for estimating consumer acceptance of vehicles with alternative powertrain technologies is presented. The approach is based on the non-compensatory ELECTRE TRI method and compares hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles to conventional models. Criteria considered are ownership costs and restrictions to vehicle use, which apply mainly to electric vehicles. The methodology is applied to a case study of 94 vehicles of different market segments and alternative powertrains. The analysis is carried out per segment and considers two driver profiles, city and all-purpose, and a baseline scenario for all cases. Output is tested for statistical significance, with powertrain technology as disaggregating factor, and a sensitivity analysis on the base scenario is also carried out, as well as a comparison with results derived by a compensatory multicriteria method (TOPSIS). Results show that conventional vehicles are the top choice for the small vehicles segment, due to lower purchase prices and higher use flexibility. For medium sized vehicles, all powertrain technologies are competitive for city drivers, whereas for all-purpose drivers, use restrictions for electric vehicles make these less attractive. The baseline scenario and sensitivity analysis highlight that opting for an electric vehicle depends strongly on the driver's use flexibility needs. As such, an electric vehicle can be either very attractive or outright unusable, regardless of financial considerations. It is also seen that plug-in hybrids do not present any significant advantage, as compared to other, non-electric choices, due to their higher purchase prices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The hesitant 2-tuple linguistic set (H2TLS), a special case of hesitant 2-tuple linguistic representation model, not only can express the qualitative preferences of the decision makers (DMs), but can effectively reflect their uncertainty and hesitancy with the help of translation parameter containing more than one element assigned to each linguistic variable of the linguistic term set (LTS). This paper develops an outranking method to address the solution to multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems in the context of hesitant 2-tuple linguistic information. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. One is to propose the outranking relations of H2TLEs based on the proposed directional Hausdorff distance. Another is to establish an outranking method, similar to the ELECTRE method, to solve MCGDM problems in which attributes are evaluated by hesitant 2-tuple linguistic arguments under certain criteria. Last but not the least, a numerical example and a comparison analysis of the results obtained both in the proposed method and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method for H2TLSs based on the generalized distance measure are conducted to verify the practicality and effectiveness of the work. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For the issue that users are often sensitive to the QoS (Quality of Service) of mobile applications, cloudlet has emerged as a novel paradigm which provides closer computing resources to users to preserve the QoS of mobile applications. By scheduling complex computing tasks to cloudlets, the energy consumption of mobile devices and the transmission latency of tasks are enabled to decrease. However, as the number of mobile applications access to cloudlets increases, preserving the QoS of mobile applications poses a challenge while offloading tasks to cloudlets. In view of this challenge, a QoS-Aware work-flow scheduling method (MWSM) is designed in this paper. Technically, we model each mobile application to be scheduled as a workflow and analyze the workflow scheduling problem. Then, we formulate the QoS-Aware workflow scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. Afterwards, NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) is adopted to minimize energy consumption, transmission latency and operation cost of workflows. Furthermore, ELECTRE is employed to select the most optimal scheduling strategy. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and potential of our proposed scheduling method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This study aims to define a municipal Solid Waste Management (SWM) strategy using Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) and ELECTRE method. Four waste treatment technologies were considered: recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling. Firstly, a Multi-objective Linear Programing (MOLP) model was developed. The solutions obtained from this model were ranked using the ELECTRE method. It was considered as case study a hypothetical city of 1,000,000 of inhabitants, presenting the average Brazilian waste per capita generation and composition. The results indicate 21 optimal solutions. The top ranked solution presents a combination of all the technologies considered. This solution presents the following waste allocation: 51.4% composted, 18.4% recycled, 16.7% landfilled and 13.5% incinerated. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying waste composition and criterion weights. The waste composition sensitivity was evaluated by substituting the average waste characteristics of Brazil to Europe, Japan and USA ones. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ranking of solutions was very sensitive to waste composition changes and low sensitive to the variation of criterion preferences. Thus, although the MOP model presented is a simple approach for SWM when compared with other literature models, it shows to be efficient. The proposed model is able to decide between the trades-off related with the material allocation. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania. All rights reserved.},

The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was used to calculate the sustainable benefit weights and the performance of water uses relative to the sustainable benefits, which were inputs to the Electre III method, used to determine the rank order of water uses for the interest groups. The hierarchies of the set of water use preferences indicate conflicts. The results demonstrate the need to develop an institutional framework governing the sustainable multiple use of the reservoir analyzed, negotiating adverse impacts associated with population growth, regional development and mitigation of conflicts among the four stakeholders. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In order to determine required wastewater treatment plants (WWTP’s) efficiencies, several methodologies have been proposed to assist the sewage treatment systems process selection, usually aiming to achieve economic objectives. However, in water resources problems solving, search involves multiple and conflicting objectives. This work used, for Pardo’s river basin (Espírito Santo State, Brazil), water quality simulation model, optimization technique and multiobjective analysis for selecting sewage treatment systems, taking into account Brazilian environmental effluents Biochemical Oxygen Demand standards, imposed by CONAMA Resolution 430/2011. After proposing an optimization model that allowed the estimation of minimum organic matter removal efficiencies, a multiobjective analysis was applied by using the ELECTRE III method, which selected sewage treatment systems for localities responsible for domestic wastewater disposal in Pardo’s river basin. The results indicated that keeping the effluents standards can produce treatment plants overestimation and inadequate allocated financial resources distribution for sewage treatment plants implementation. Treatment systems such as Submerged Aerated Biofilters (with Nitrification), Wetlands and Facultative Ponds were the most selected, considering different contexts appreciated in this work. © 2018, Brazilian Journal of Water Resources.

abstract={The topic of the research is a specific feature of the region within a group of regions - the relative environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation within it; relative, as it refers to the environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation in regions belonging to a selected group of regions. The research revolves around the issue of the methodology for assessing (quantifying) the relative environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation in a region (province). Developing such a methodology and presenting an example of its application is, thus, the aim of this work. The methodology comprises two parts. The first of them pertains to generic, e.g.: climate, soil-water, hydrological, etc. quantification of the relative environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation in regions (provinces), while the second - the synthesis of these partial generic validities into one indicator - the relative environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation in a region (province). When realizing the first part, indicators characterizing the partial validities for developing drainage and irrigation in subregions (districts) are used, whereas in the second - a fragment of the ELECTRE III multi-criteria dialogue method of ordering of variants. Based on the proposed methodology, the individual provinces of Poland were classified. The classification was carried out based on such generic validities for the development of irrigation as climatic, soil-water, hydrological and environmental-ecological validity. According to this classification, Opolskie Province is characterized by the strongest environmental validity of developing irrigation, whereas Małopolskie Province - the lowest. Preliminarily analyses confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the proposed methodology for assessing the relative environmental validity of developing drainage and irrigation in the provinces. © 2017 Edmund Kaca, published by De Gruyter Open.},

One of the risks associated with the selection of study is the incompatibility with the needs of the current job vacancies in companies that significantly affect the future of these students. Since there are many criteria that must be considered, then through this recommender system, students are able to know what fields are the most appropriate for them. This system is built based on Electre method. When a student fills out a questionnaire, he must be consistent with his/her answer to obtain the best output based on his/her will and characteristics.

In order to preserve the quality and safety of the product contained in them, there are currently a variety of flexible packaging equipment options available. However their relative costs and performance differ. This study proposes an application of a ranking methodology to assess a selection of the most suitable flexible packaging equipment. The adequate criteria in the selection of equipment have been identified, and the considered options are assessed, considering the decision maker's preferences and existing constraints. The options are ranked in terms of their suitability for selecting equipment by using the Electre III method. The results obtained from the simulation experiment highlight the effectiveness of the model in outranking different options in the process of equipment selection. © 2017 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Association rule mining plays a vital role in knowledge discovery in databases. The difficult task is mining useful and non-redundant rules, in fact in most cases, the real datasets lead to a huge number of rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. Several techniques are proposed such as rule clustering, informative cover method, quality measurements, etc. Another way to selecting relevant association rules, we believe it is necessary to integrate a decisional approach within the knowledge discovery process; to solve the problem, we propose an approach to discover a category of relevant association rules based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) by using association rules as actions and quality measurements as criteria. Finally, we conclude our work by an empirical study to illustrate the performance of our proposed approach. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

To guide stakeholders and project managers to take decisions related to the outsourcing of one or multiple activities, we propose a decision support system for classifying organizational risks, as example of operational risks, into different risk categories. The classification system is based on a set of performance metrics that measure both the likelihood and impact criterias. Electre-Tri a formal multi-criteria decision analysis method, was used as the foundation for this task. This method allowed us to cluster various organizational risks in different risk categories based on our current knowledge of those risks, and based on the best professional judgments.

Project objectives may dynamically change in time, hence it is not easy to satisfy them, especially when related to complex projects. In detail, they can be subjected to several and different risk conditions which have an important impact on the project success. In this context, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are effective tools to carry out the risk management. In particular, the present research proposes the use of MCDM with a specific focus on the ELECTRE TRI method. The last one is able to evaluate and assign projects under analysis into ordered and different risk classes. The purpose consists in extending the idea of the "probability and impact matrix" tool by adopting a multidimensional perspective. The proposed approach is applied to a case study related to an Oil & Gas project and a sensitivity analysis is shown to demonstrate the robustness of the results.},

The ABC classification of inventory items is based on their performance expressed by weighted scores. In this paper, a new ABC classification model - based on a simplified ELECTRE III method - will be used as an aggregation procedure to compute the items scores. Since the application of the simplified ELECTRE III requires the knowledge of some parameter values (e.g. indifference, preference and veto thresholds), the Continuous Variable Neighborhood Search (CVNS) metaheuristic is used for their estimation. To analyze the performance of the proposed classification model with respect to some existing models, a benchmark dataset from an Hospital Respiratory Therapy Unit (HRTU) is used.},

abstract={This paper discusses the properties of the asymmetric part of an outranking relation built as in ELECTRE. Such relations have been used in the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B. We show that they have properties that are somewhat different from that of outranking relations. Indeed, contrary to outranking relations, they allow to have at the same time veto and bonus effects. We suggest that this explains the difficulty in analyzing the properties of the pseudodisjunctive version of ELECTRE TRI-B and the complexity of the elicitation methods of its parameters. We present conditions that characterize such relations. © 2014 The Authors. International Transactions in Operational Research © 2014 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.},

abstract={The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has the potential to connect millions of devices in the near future. Since they agree on this potential, several standard organizations need to focus on improved general architecture for M2M communications. Currently, there is a lack of consensus to improve the general feasibility of M2M communication. Heterogeneous Mobile Ad hoc Networks (HetMANETs) can normally be considered appropriate for M2M challenges. When a mobile node (MN) moves inside a HetMANET, various challenges including a selection of the target network and energy efficient scanning take place, which need to be addressed for efficient handover. To cope with these issues, we propose a handover management scheme that efficiently initiates a handover process and selects an optimal network. Our proposed scheme is composed of two phases, i.e., i) the MN performs handover triggering based on the optimization of the Receive Signal Strength (RSS) from an access point/base station (AP/BS), and, ii) the network selection process is carried out by considering different parameters such as delay, jitter, velocity, network load, and energy consumption by the network interface. Moreover, if there are more networks available, then the MN selects the one that can provide the highest quality-of- service (QoS) using the Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) decision model. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared in the context of the number of handovers, average stay-time of an MN in the network, and energy consumption against periodic and adaptive scanning. Similarly, a two- state Markov model is defined that efficiently distribute the number nodes on the available access points and base stations. The proposed scheme efficiently optimizes the handoff related parameters and outperforms existing schemes. © 2015 IEEE.},

This chapter describes the methodology of the decision model and a case study to exemplify its use is presented. The proposed methodology determines a ranking of possible alternatives after its evaluations according important criteria. The proposed methodology that involves decision maker’s preference information makes the decision process more explicit, rational and efficient.

The performance evaluation is based on six main criteria; competency, experience and skill, teamwork and time punctuality, personal characteristics, capability and outcome. The study was conducted at one of the SME food manufacturing companies in Selangor. From the study, it is found that AHP and FAHP yielded the "outcome" criteria as the most important criteria.

abstract={In many real-world multiple criteria decision problems, the family of criteria has a hierarchical structure presented in the form of a tree. The leaves of the tree correspond to elementary criteria on which a finite set of alternatives is directly evaluated. Evaluations of alternatives on elementary criteria are aggregated to form a sub-criterion at an upper level of the tree. Then, evaluations of alternatives on sub-criteria having the same predecessor in the hierarchy tree are aggregated again in a sub-criterion of a higher level, and so on, until the aggregation at the general goal criterion, which is the root of the tree, where the alternatives are finally ranked from the best to the worst. At each node of the tree, above the leaves, we are considering the aggregation of multiple criteria evaluations using the ELECTRE-III method, based on building and exploiting outranking relations for each pair of alternatives. As the result of ELECTRE-III is a partial preorder of alternatives, the sub-criteria are ordering the alternatives just partially. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new way of calculating concordance and discordance indices that take part in the definition of an outranking relation aggregating the (partially ordered) evaluations on sub-criteria. A robustness analysis has been performed to analyze the behavior of the proposed method in different settings. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

In the first part, it elaborates on the development of such a framework, with emphasis placed on the evaluation stage. More specifically, two multicriteria evaluation techniques are used (ELECTRE I and REGIME) as tools that can relief 'method uncertainty' and deal with conflicts and different perspectives in the decision making process. In the second part, this decision support framework is applied in a real world decision problem, namely the selection of wind park location in a Greek region (Tanagra-Boiotia) for the installation of a wind park that will partly serve the energy demand of a newly planned industrial area. Finally, some conclusions are drawn as to the empirical results obtained by the two multicriteria methods as well as their capacity to deal with multiobjective evaluation problems.},

abstract={A new set of indices for monitoring the effects of implementing new regional development policies of the European Union, as well as other sectoral policies with territorial effects, resulted into the creation of new flexible systems, able to increase the administrative capacity to access structural and cohesion funds. The novelty of this study consists of the original methodology embedding mathematical methods (i.e., the ELECTRE and the index of development methods) in a GIS in order to produce hierarchies of the territorial indices at the NUTS levels III and V, displayed as charts and maps underlining the disparities between the socioeconomic, cultural and environmental aspects of the development. Our results suggest that the Romanian poorly developed regions are located in the south. Methodologically, the potential of the approach developed by this study recommends its usage as a planning tool of regional development. The limitations are due to the sparse monitoring and lack of data covering Romania.},

In this specific problem, public and expert opinions towards the privatization of urban bus lines were collected through a comprehensive survey to determine the best operation system; either by the local authority or private operators. The data collected include the opinions of four different groups of people namely: system users, transportation administrators, civil organizations and experts in the transportation field. The ELECTRE model yielded that the privatization of the bus system is preferred (by 37 to 14 points) over its operation by the public entity (local municipality). © 2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract={The problems concerning the component improvement of an existing regional telecommunications network, including determination of bottlenecks, redesigning of components, and system expansion by addition of components are discussed. The basic combinatorial models are multicriteria ranking and a multicriteria multiple-choice knapsack problem. The set of requirements (criteria) applied to the system improved comprises reliability, throughput, controllability, and other features. The solution is attained by using the two-stage combinatorial heuristic scheme (the ranking of local designing variants of improvement and the multiple-choice knapsack problem). The ranking procedure is based on the Electre-like version of outranking. The multiple choice knapsack is constructed by means of greedy heuristics. Two variants of improvement of the initial network, namely, a partial redesigning and a full redesigning, are analyzed. The proposed approach is illustrated with the realistic example of a regional (municipal) telecommunications network comprising ten node types. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={During the last years, the global market of renewable energy resources is in a continuous growth. This paper deals with the decision making problem of a specific investor who is willing to invest in the development of a small photovoltaic park, in the Greek PV Market. The main objective of this paper is to structure this specific problem as a multicriteria decision problem. A set of eight alternative contractor companies, responsible for studying and manufacturing the PV system is identified and evaluated on 12 criteria which are grouped in three categories: company profile, financial and technical aspects of the submitted proposals. The paper outlines the implementation of the ELECTRE I multicriteria method in order to support the investor in choosing the best alternative. Although the method does not provide initially a single choice, a robustness analysis of the method follows so as the best available alternative to be selected.

abstract={The paper describes multicriteria modular approach to redesign/improvement of a networked system (e.g., sensor/ actuator network, communication network). Generally, the approach consists of the following stages: (1) revelation of system bottlenecks, (2) generation of alternative improvement actions for each system bottleneck (i.e., new communication facilities as design alternatives for the upgrade process), (3) multicriteria assessment of the improvement actions, (4) multicriteria ranking of the improvement actions, and (5) forming a generalized improvement plan while taking into account a total resource constraint (multiple choice knapsack problem). A set of requirements/ criteria is divided into several groups (criteria clusters: reliability, performance, manageability, etc.). An outranking technique (version of Electre method) is used for multicriteria ranking. A multistage heuristic is used for solving multiple choice knapsack problem. A numerical illustrative example of a realworld cooperative communication network is used to describe the suggested redesign approach. Three redesign schemes are analyzed: (1) a new full system design, (2) a partial system redesign, and (3) a hybrid redesign framework. ©2010 IEEE.},

Nowadays there does not exist any process based upon a rigorous method to select the right clone for the right place to get the highest return on investment. The only known selection method is to use the experience of different protagonists acting in the plantation. So, we need a tool that takes into account different very important criteria in order to achieve the main objective. This goal is achieved by using multicriteria analysis methods to clone selection. The ranking procedure uses Electre III. For each criterion, indifference and preference thresholds are determined after establishing the relative importance of each criterion that includes rubber tapping, cumulative production during 15 years, cumulative production between 15 and 25 years, wind resistance, disease resistance, physiological resistance, rafting, quality of the hevea.},

This is accomplished by integrating in the search process the DM's preferences to guide the search and limit both the cognitive effort, in assessing Pareto-optimal solutions with distinct characteristics, and the computational effort, by reducing the scope of the search according to the preferences expressed by the DM.

abstract={Agents and multi-agent systems constitute nowadays a very active field of research. This field is very multidisciplinary since it is sustained by Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, etc. In most agent applications, the autonomous components need to interact. They need to communicate in order to solve differences of opinion and conflicts of interest. They also need to work together or simply inform each other. It is however important to note that a lot of existing works do not take into account the agents' preferences. In addition, individual decisions in the multi-agent domain are rarely sufficient for producing optimal plans which satisfy all the goals. Therefore, agents need to cooperate to generate the best multi-agent plan through sharing tentative solutions, exchanging sub goals, or having other agents' goals to satisfy. In this paper, we propose a new negotiation mechanism independent of the domain properties in order to handle real-time goals. The mechanism is based on the well-known Contract net Protocol. Integrated Station of Production agents will be equipped with a sufficient behavior to carry out practical operations and simultaneously react to the complex problems caused by the dynamic scheduling in real situations. These agents express their preferences by using ELECTRE III method in order to solve differences. The approach is tested through simple scenarios. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={The design of a CBR system involves the use of similarity metrics. For many applications, various functions can be adopted to compare case features and to aggregate them into a global similarity measure. Given the availability of multiple similarity metrics, the designer is hence left with two options in order to come up with a working system: Either select one similarity metric or try to combine multiple metrics in a super-metric. In this paper, we study how techniques borrowed from multicriteria decision aid can be applied to CBR for combining the results of multiple similarity metrics. The problem of multimetrics retrieval is presented as an instance of the problem of ranking alternatives based on multiple attributes. Discrete methods such as ELECTRE II have been proposed by the multicriteria decision aid community to address such situations. We conducted our experiments for ranking cases with ELECTRE II, a procedure based on pairwise comparisons. We used textual cases and multiple metrics. Our results indicate that the use of a combination of metrics with a multicriteria decision aid method can increase retrieval precision and provide an advantage over weighted sum combinations especially when similarity is measured on scales that are different in nature. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={This article contributes to the advancement and evolution of outranking decision-making methodologies, with a novel essay on the ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) family of methods. Its primary target is to unfold the constituents and expound the implementation of the ELECTRE II method for group decision making in complex Pythagorean fuzzy framework. This results in the complex Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE II method. By inception, it is intrinsically superior to models using one-dimensional data. It is designed to perform the pairwise comparisons of the alternatives using the core notions of concordance, discordance and indifferent sets, which is then followed by the construction of complex Pythagorean fuzzy concordance and discordance matrices. Further, the strong and weak outranking relations are developed by the comparison of concordance and discordance indices with the concordance and discordance levels. Later, the forward, reverse and average rankings of the alternatives are computed by the dint of strong and weak outranking graphs. This methodology is supported by a case study for the selection of wastewater treatment process, and by a numerical example for the selection of the best cloud solution for a big data project. Its consistency is confirmed by an effectiveness test and comparison analysis with the Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE II and complex Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE I methods. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Renewable hydrogen production plays a key role in transitioning to a hydrogen economy. For this, developing countries are encouraged to keep up with industrialized nations. As such, this study seeks to evaluate the potential of all capital cities of Iran in terms of solar-based hydrogen production and prioritize the nominated alternatives. This step is highly valued because finding the most suitable place for this purpose can lead to substantial outcomes and consequently avoid failure. Therefore, here a 20-kW solar power plant is simulated by PVsyst 6.7 software and meteorological data of 31 capital cities is extracted using Meteonorm 7.1 software. Considering all losses associated with solar power plants, electricity and hydrogen generation are studied under the scenarios of using fixed optimal angle for solar cells, seasonally adjustable slope, single axis tacker and dual-axis tracker. Analyzing the impact of each technology on hydrogen production, MCDM approaches are applied to rank the stations considering 13 conflicting criteria. The numerical results demonstrate the minimum and maximum of hydrogen production for annual optimal angle scenario are related to Sari and Zahedan respectively with amounts of 457.4 kg/year and 671.5 kg/year. Also, under the optimal seasonal slope scenario hydrogen production efficiency increases by up to 3.8%. This figure for two other cases of single-axis tracker and dual-axis tracker is expected to be 30.6%, and 34.3%, respectively. Using the TOPSIS method, Yasuj is selected as the most suitable city for the purpose of this study. This recommendation is supported by the results of ranking analysis using WS, MAPPACC, and ELECTRE III methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents Outranking-based Particle Swarm Optimisation (O-PSO) a novel metaheuristic to address the multi-objective Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem. It is a particle swarm optimisation algorithm enriched with the preferences of the Decision Maker (DM), articulated in a fuzzy relational system based on ELECTRE III. Unlike other multi-objective metaheuristics, O-PSO searches for the Region of Interest (RoI) instead of approximating a sample of the complete Pareto frontier. The RoI is the subset consisting of those Pareto-efficient solutions that satisfy the outranking relations, that is, they are the best solutions in terms of the DM's system of preferences. Therefore, O-PSO not only approximates the Pareto solutions but also supports multicriteria decision analysis of the schedules. The efficiency of O-PSO is validated on a benchmark of synthetic instances from the scientific literature, where the Wilcoxon rank-sum test provides statistical evidence that O-PSO offers high-quality solutions when compared with two state-of-the-art metaheuristics; specifically, O-PSO is capable of generating a greater proportion of solutions (on average, ranging from 7% to 14%) dominating those of the state-of-the-art algorithms, as well as finding more solutions (from 13% to 18%) that satisfy the DM's preferences. O-PSO is also applied to a real-world case study in the transport industry to provide evidence for its applicability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is very common to use linguistic information to solve decision-making problems in real life, and the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (DHHFLTS) has been widely used because of its powerful ability of expressing complex linguistic information. There is no doubt that the comparison method of double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (DHHFLEs) not only occupies an important theoretical and practical position, but also is the basis for further study of DHHFLTSs. However, the existing comparison methods of DHHFLEs still have some limitations. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DHHFLE comparison method, which is an improvement and perfection of the existing DHHFLE comparison methods. In addition, considering that the current research on distance and similarity measures of DHHFLEs is mostly based on the algebraic point of view, this paper proposes a cosine similarity measure of DHHFLEs, which fills the gap in the study of distance and similarity measures from the geometric point of view. Then, the cosine similarity-based DHHFL-ELECTRE II method is proposed to solve the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem in the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment. Finally, this method is used to solve a MADM problem in the performance evaluation of financial logistics enterprises. The results show that the proposed method has certain applicability and feasibility. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

After an in-depth literature review and interviews with German industry experts in pharmaceutical sector, barriers and SIs are ranked using an integrated Analytical hierarchy process-elimination and choice expressing reality-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ELECTRE-DEMATEL) approach. &#x201C;Linking virtual reality and reality&#x201D; is found to be the most critical deterrent to the adoption of industry 5.0, and falls into a causal group, which signifies their influence on other deterrents. &#x201C;Measures for better connectivity with patients&#x201D; is of utmost importance for German firms to ensure secure communication and safeguard patient data. The findings also highlight the problems with the adoption of high-tech innovations due to lack of standardization and fair benchmarking policies on industry 5.0. This article concludes by proposing an industry 5.0 framework. The inhibitors to adopting industry 5.0 were investigated in this article, the results of which will assist practitioners and decision makers to understand the issues with industry 5.0. The results of this article will help potential adopters of this technology to look for the SIs. This will therefore pave the path for effective adoption of industry 5.0 across the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. IEEE},

abstract={This work proposes a Fuzzy Proximity Index Ranking method to facilitate multi-criteria decision making in fuzzy environment. The proposed method is derived from proximity index value approach by incorporating the fuzzy concept to take care of vagueness in the information provided by the experts. The method is implemented on several multi-criteria decision-making problems taken from the literature to investigate its performance. Ranking results of the proposed method are found closer to those of Fuzzy TOPSIS, Fuzzy MOORA, Fuzzy VIKOR and Fuzzy ELECTRE. Further, a few case studies on rank reversal are presented on three different fuzzy scenarios to examine the robustness of the method. The results revealed that the proposed method suffers least from the rank reversal issue and it generates reasonably accurate ranking order compared to other techniques. Hence, the proposed method is considered a simple fuzzy based multi-criteria decision approach which can be a reliable substitute for existing methods. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Stock selection for effective investment decisions is a valuable and attractive research interest for many years. Owing to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market, many fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods were proposed to solve stock selection problems. However, these methods have difficulty in characterizing unreliable information, which is widespread in the stock market, and handling the non-compensation among multiple criteria. In this paper, an innovative method is developed from the perspectives of information reliability and criterion non-compensation to manage stock selection problems. First, the Z-number, which is a powerful tool for describing real-life information and identifying information reliability, is introduced to depict stock evaluation information. Second, the outranking degree of Z-numbers is defined based on the fuzzy and probability information. Subsequently, some outranking aggregation and exploitation procedures are presented based on the idea of Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) I to handle the non-compensation among stock evaluation criteria. By integrating the above studies, a Z-number ELECTRE I MCDM method is developed. Finally, a stock investment object selection problem is solved, and some discussions and analyses are conducted to testify the applicability and validity of this method. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Task scheduling is an attractive research topic in cloud computing nowadays. This process is very challenging and well known as NP-complete problem. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of user’s request and provider’s resource in cloud computing, the scheduling process still needs intelligent algorithms to achieve an efficient cloud resource allocation and to guarantee a good Quality of Service (QoS) for the users and their request classes. An important aspect for meeting these objectives is to design an effective task scheduling scheme which can not only satisfy users’ varying priorities and QoS requirements, but also enhance providers’ profit and system performances. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy to address the priority issue in both users’ requests and providers’ resources. We propose an efficient priority tasks scheduling called MCPTS, where the priority is adjusted according to four tasks’ parameters including length, waiting time, deadline and burst time. MCPTS scheme consists of three sub-models such as tasks priority, task queueing priority and resources priority. A new hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, namely ELECTRE III, and a meta-heuristic algorithm called differential evolution are proposed to evaluate and determine tasks’ priorities. Further, we introduce a novel dynamic priority-queue algorithm based on queueing model. Furthermore, we adjust dynamically the resources priority based on tasks priority model in order to design an efficient and flexible relation between both resources and tasks classes. The proposed algorithm is validated through the CloudSim simulator. The experimental results indicate the superiority of MCPTS algorithm compared to other existing algorithms. Also, it shows the effectiveness of our algorithm in providing good system performance, satisfying users’ priorities as well as QoS requirements, enhancing load balancing and improving resources utilization. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The aluminium (A), copper (C) and aluminium alloy reinforced with graphite particles of various weight percentage (5-A1,10-A2,15- A3) were used as tool materials. The composites were fabricated using stir casting technique. The findings showed that the titanium alloy machined with A1 composite tool offers the highest MRR, the Ctool has the lowest EWR, and the A2 composite tool results in good surface finish. The surface of specimens produced using A1 tool exhibits poor surface quality owing to the eczema surface. Specimens machined with theCtool have a remelted layer, pockmarks, and an uneven fusion structure, which were not present in specimens machined with the A2 tool.

abstract={The design, implementation and use of wastewater treatment systems (WTS) are fundamental to mitigate hydrological and environmental problems, and to improve population health. Furthermore, the significant advances in treatment systems technology offer, nowadays, several alternatives and provide many combinations of WTS which must be correctly evaluated and constitute a decision problem for public and private investors and decision makers. Thus, this article presents a multi-criteria methodology based on six steps for the evaluation of WTS considering relevant economic, social, technical and environmental criteria. Particularly, forty-eight main criteria were identified and ranked considering their importance based on the previous literature. This methodology was applied in a Brazilian sanitation company in a specific treatment area of approximately five thousand inhabitants and with recurrent environmental problems, such as the contamination and low efficiency of wastewater treatment. Twenty available alternatives were considered and twelve criteria were selected for this application. The AHP and ELECTRE II methods were combined to weight the different criteria and to rank the most suitable WTS. This methodology can be extended and applied in different scenarios to improve the decision-making process. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In order to facilitate the decision making in spatial applications, several methods are available to aggregate the performance of decision-makers. The multitude of these methods makes it difficult to choose one method over another. Two main types of methods are used, the outranking methods which are based on bottom-up approach and the hierarchical analysis methods which are based on top-down approach. These methods can be adapted to this kind of applications and can be integrated into GIS which is an essential tool in spatial management and decision making. Methods developed according to the first approach are different from those developed in accordance with the second one. This study aims to present a comparison between two multicriteria decision-making methods ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) Tri and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to assess land suitability for agriculture. Twelve criteria [water reserve easily utilizable, drainage, permeability, potential of hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity, active limestone, cation exchange capacity, soil texture, soil useful depth, slope, availability of labor, proximity (roads)] grouped in five factors (agronomic, planning, land enhancement and improvement, soil conservation and environment protection, and socioeconomic conditions) were used in this study. An application has been carried out on the area of Mleta in Algeria. Two land suitability maps for durum wheat have been produced by the two procedures (optimistic and pessimistic) available in ELECTRE Tri, and another map has been obtained by AHP. After the comparison between the obtained results, it was apparent that ELECTRE Tri is more appropriate for the land suitability assessment for agriculture despite its complexity given the large number of required parameters. The subjective parameters available in ELECTRE Tri make it possible to take into account imprecise data. Another advantage of this method lies in the way of the decision-makers' preferences aggregation and the assignment of the land units to classes of predefined categories. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The evaluation of serious games is generally a complicated process because there is usually more than one dimension to be evaluated. In our Serious Games evaluation tool, we have four dimensions in each one we have a several well-defined evaluation criteria's. So we intend to use a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method (FMCDM) which has been integrated in order to validate the selection of the different alternatives and the weighting of the multiple criteria involved in our tool. However, even if all methods have the capacity to take into account the imprecision and uncertainty of human judgments, each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the context in which it is used. This makes it very difficult to choose one method over another. Moreover, there is no consensus in the scientific community on any particular method. In this paper, we present the use of the fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy ELECTRE methods for ranking the evaluation dimensions / alternatives used in our Serious Games evaluation model in which the fuzzy AHP method was used. These three chosen methods, which adapt perfectly to our context, given its discrete aspect, represent respectively the three categories of FMADM (fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making methods): fuzzy pairwise comparison methods, fuzzy distance based methods and fuzzy outranking methods. The results obtained from the application of these fuzzy methods converge towards the same ranking of dimensions / alternatives. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.},

abstract={Energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) has become an indispensable trend of green life. How to choose a suitable technology for ECER under complex decision-making scenarios has become a key issue faced by traditional industrial enterprises. In this paper, a new integrated decision-making framework is established for technology-selection problems. Firstly, to describe complex linguistic information more accurately and reduce information loss, this framework employs the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (DHHFLTSs) to describe the performance of alternatives. To avoid data redundancy and simplify the computation, we improve the operations of double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (DHHFLEs) and propose a new comparison method for DHHFLEs. Secondly, based on the proposed normalized projection-based difference measurement, a novel method is proposed to derive the weights of experts regarding each criterion, the group decision-making method based on the best-worst method is also utilized to derive the criteria's weights via consistent pairwise comparisons. Further, an integrated generalized TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making)-ELECTRE II (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality II) method is established to rank alternatives, which has the advantages of dealing with the non-compensatory problem of criteria and considering risk-aversion behavior of experts simultaneously. Subsequently, a case study of emission-reduction technology investment is provided to manifest the practicality and reliability of the given framework. Finally, the preponderance and effectiveness of the proposed method are illuminated through a comparative analysis with several existing representative methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={E-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content, assessment and discussion. Yet, after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data, it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. It is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. On the other hand, multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. This study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. In this context, the research has two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to utilize the ELECTRE TRI method, which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. Secondly, it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the ELECTRE TRI method and the classification in the real life. To that end, two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. The first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. Three different categories are identified in the first data set by the ELECTRE TRI method. Based on this finding, the classification in the ELECTRE TRI method is compared to the real-life classification, which shows a medium-level correlation. Two different categories are identified in the second data set. There is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. In conclusion, this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The multicriteria group decision-making method in fuzzy environment has become the focus of many scholars. The purpose of this paper is to extend the traditional ORESTE (organísation, rangement et Synthèse de données relarionnelles) method to solve the multi-criteria group decision-making problem under IT2FS environment. The main contributions of this paper are to define a new similarity measure and a global preference score function based on the new similarity measure. First, a new similarity measure of two IT2FSs is defined. Then, some properties of the new similarity measure are investigated, and a comparison between the new similarity measure and other existing similarity measures is provided. Subsequently, a global preference score function is defined based on the new similarity measure. The average preference score is derived using the power average operator, and the weak order of the alternatives is obtained according to the average preference score. Furthermore, a PIR (P: preference; I: indifference; R: incomparability) structure is constructed to reach a strong ordering of alternatives. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a practical case of selecting the best supplier involving comparisons with the ELECTRE-based outranking method and IT2FS-TOPSIS method. And the new approach proposed in this paper can be applied to e-commerce, medical decision making, product recommendation, and fault diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: Adopting the circular economy (CE) notion in the supply chain perspective is necessary for the sustainability viewpoint. However, such practices are deficient, especially in developing countries like India, because of several obstacles. The purpose of this study was to create an approach for circular supply chain management (CSCM) adaption in Indian rubber industries by identifying and evaluating its associated obstacles. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the grey-based ELECTRE method had been employed in this research to obtain the mutual rankings of the identified obstacles based on their impressions on the CSCM prosperity criteria through a case study and involving diverse expert's opinions. Findings: Presented study's findings illustrate that “Lack of consumer knowledge and consciousness towards environmental sustainability” was found to be the top-ranked obstacle followed by “Unwillingness towards supply chain re-structuring”. Research limitations/implications: The obstacles' prioritized rankings could help leaders to create sequential strategies for adapting a resilient CSCM structure by systematically eliminating these obstacles. Moreover, the pinpointed critical obstacles could be investigated further in separate studies and generate future studies' scope. Originality/value: During the extensive literature survey, it had been found that the CSCM practices are in the fledgling stage in the developing country's context. Moreover, studies related to CSCM adaption in rubber-based manufacturing industries were much lacking. Presented work is peculiar, aiming to accelerate the CSCM adaption in the industrial rubber sector in developing countries like India. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The theory involving T-spherical fuzziness provides an exceptionally good tool to efficiently manipulate the impreciseness, equivocation, and vagueness inherent in multiple criteria assessment and decision-making processes. By exploiting the notions of score functions and distance measures for complex T-spherical fuzzy information, this paper aims to propound an innovational T-spherical fuzzy ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choice Translating REality) approach to handling intricate and convoluted evaluation problems. Several newly-created score functions are employed from the comparative perspective to constitute a core procedure concerning concordance and discordance determination in the current T-spherical fuzzy ELECTRE method. By the agency of a realistic application, this paper appraises the usefulness and efficacy of available score functions in the advanced ELECTRE mechanism under T-spherical fuzzy uncertainties. This paper incorporates two forms of Minkowski distance measures into the core procedure; moreover, the effectuality of the advocated measure in differentiating T-spherical fuzzy information is validated. The effectiveness outcomes of the evolved method have been investigated through the medium of an investment decision regarding potential company options for extending the business scope. The real-world application also explores the comparative advantages of distinct score functions in tackling multiple criteria decision-making tasks. Finally, this paper puts forward a conclusion and future research directions. © 2021 - The authors. Published by IOS Press.},

abstract={Sustainable urban evaluation is an important management tool to grasp the status of urban development in real time and to make policy adjustments. In this study, the evaluation indicator system is constructed from the three dimensions of economy, society, and environment. The ELECTRE (elimination et choice translation reality) model based on information entropy weighting is employed to evaluate urban sustainability. The model applies three-dimensional data to explore the dynamics of sustainable urban development. The spatial measurement model is used to explore the spatial effects of cities. Finally, 17 cities in Henan Province from 2013 to 2017 are used as case studies for urban sustainable development evaluation. The results show that, in 2013-2017, the sustainability of cities such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Sanmenxia was stable at a high level, while the sustainability levels of Kaifeng, Luohe, and Xinyang showed a fluctuating downward trend, and the sustainability levels of Puyang, Nanyang, and Xinxiang showed a fluctuating upward trend. Among the 17 cities, Zhengzhou has the highest sustainability level and its economic and social sustainability levels are significantly better than other cities. Zhoukou is the city with the lowest level of sustainability. In addition, from 2013 to 2016, the level of urban sustainability was not spatially correlated but gradually presented positive spatial correlation and the characteristics of clustering distribution in 2017. The cities such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Jiaozuo are mainly represented by "high-high (H-H)"agglomeration. In contrast, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, and Zhumadian are mainly represented by "low-low (L-L)"agglomeration. This research provides suggestions and decision-making support for promoting urban sustainability. © 2021 Huimin Li et al.},

abstract={Land conversion to organic agriculture is the answer to land degradation problems that interfere with land resources sustainability. An evaluation of land-use suitability is crucial to measure the appropriateness of land for agricultural cultivation. Specifically, organic rice cultivation has some particular standard criteria such as temperature, rainfall, soil depth, pH, c-organic, slope, erosion level, a transition period that influence ranking results, and land suitability classes. Eight organic farmlands were used as alternatives, namely Sawangan, Mangunsari, Tirtosari, Podosoko, Butuh, Krogowanan, Kapuhan, and Jati. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy process is used to determine the level of importance of the criteria based on weight assessments by three agricultural experts. The ELECTRE method is applied to rank the most suitable land from several alternatives for organic rice cultivation. The combination of these two multi-criteria decision-making methods complements each other to solve problems in land suitability evaluation. A web-based decision support system (DSS) was created to accelerate data processing integration and present factual information from the land suitability selection process. The implementation of DSS with fuzzy-AHP ELECTRE for evaluating land-use suitability in organic rice cultivation provided the best score for Tirtosari with Ekl=4 and spearman rank correlation the system comparison results with actual data rs=0.95. This study's results indicate that integrating the web with fuzzy-AHP ELECTRE is quite effectively applied for decision-making in organic farming. © 2021, Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum.

abstract={In many cases, complex problems cannot be accurately described by precise numerical values. Fuzzy theory provides a suitable tool for solving these problems. However, if decision makers cannot reach an agreement on the method for defining linguistic variables based on fuzzy sets, TIVFNs (triangular interval-valued fuzzy numbers) can provide more accurate modeling. Therefore, solving fuzzy MCGDM (multiple criteria group decision-making) problem with an unknown expert weight and criterion weight in TIVFNs has become an important research direction. In this paper, TIVF-VIKOR (triangular interval-valued fuzzy VIKOR) method, which is suitable for the environment of TIVFNs, is proposed to solve the problem of fuzzy MCGDM. To achieve this goal, the TIVF-VIKOR method is innovatively adopted similarity and coefficient of variation are combined to calculate expert weight, and deviation maximization method based on divergence matrix is used to calculate criterion weight. VIKOR method is used to find the compromise solutions, which are converted into the form of binary connection number, and the optimal compromise solution is obtained after ranking. The proposed method is applied to the problem of machine fault detection, and the validity and feasibility of the method are illustrated. Compared with the TOPSIS\ELECTRE method, the ranking results of the three methods are equivalent, and the fluctuation of the TIVF-VIKOR method is more distinct. © 2021 - IOS Press.

abstract={Purpose: The rapid increase in higher education institutions (HEIs) can affect the provision of quality education especially when there are no clear integrated objectives to serve the overall HEI as well as the lack of management related to human resource needs. The quality of HEIs relies on the performance of their employees who are considered as one of the most important resources. Several studies demonstrated that the concept of talent management is not well defined for HEIs and considered it as a new study; however, researchers emphasized on its importance to improve the employees' performance and to achieve sustainable competitive advantages. The main aim of this paper is to propose a faculty equity framework for talent optimization in HEIs to help these institutions to recruit the right people, manage and motivate them to achieve their future goals and serve the best quality. Design/methodology/approach: The faculty equity framework criteria are derived from the standards of national and international quality assurance and accreditation agencies which are grouped into three categories: alignment, capabilities and engagement. These criteria are used to outrank faculties and determine the entrepreneurial champions. As the framework does not require setting weights for these criteria, the authors propose to adapt the ELECTRE IV to outrank faculties. Findings: The proposed framework has given faculty a chance to assimilate the HEI dominant culture and guidance to improve their performance through comparing themselves to entrepreneurial champions who are better aligned, capable and engaged. Also, the framework offers the HEI an opportunity to effectively retain talents and achieve maximized outcomes. Originality/value: This research provides HEIs with a practical guide on how to enhance practices, policies and strategies regarding their human capital in order to achieve their missions and strategic goals. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The extraction of association rules is a very attractive data mining task and the most widespread in the business world and in modern society, trying to obtain the interesting relationship and connection between collections of articles, products or items in high transactional databases. The immense quantity of association rules obtained expresses the main obstacle that a decision maker can handle. Consequently, in order to establish the most interesting association rules, several interestingness measures have been introduced. Currently, there is no optimal measure that can be chosen to judge the selected association rules. To avoid this problem we suggest to apply ELECTRE method one of the multi-criteria decision making, taking into consideration a formal study of measures of interest according to structural properties, and intending to find a good compromise and select the most interesting association rules without eliminating any measures. Experiments conducted on reference data sets show a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed strategy. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have various applications in different fields of science. These methods can also be used as environmental impact assessment (EIA) approaches. The diversity of results of different MCDM methods has led to the development of integration strategies. In this research, the EIA of a coal washing plant in Iran has been carried out by using MCDM methods comprising TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and ELECTRE. In addition, the results of various MCDM-EIA methods were combined using the most well-known integration strategies: Borda, Copeland, and Kohler. The final MCDM-EIA results ranked the environmental components of the coal washing plant. Ecology, Landscape, and Human health risks were recognized to be the most critical environmental components for the plant. Fuzzy AHP and Monte-Carlo AHP methods produced the best results among various MCDM methods and had the same results as the final integration method. Finally, a method was proposed to evaluate the impacting factors of the plant. This method, which is called development plan evaluation (DPE), identifies the most influential factors based on the MCDM-EIA process. By using the DPE approach, it is possible to revise the factory process and identify the harmful effects of an industrial project. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Purpose: In this way, the aim of this study is to expand and evelop the application of this technique in FMEA to rank failure modes of ESQ of academic libraries in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Assessment of electronic service quality (ESQ) of libraries is significantly important according to their major roles. It should be noted that the ESQ has a significant impact on customer satisfaction, which improves organizational performance. Accordingly, low ESQ means waste of organizational resources and poor user satisfaction. So, there is a dire need to reflect reasons inducing failure modes in academic library ESQ. Thus, investigation of failure modes affecting academic library ESQ is highly important. One solution in this area is utilization of the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) as one of the widely used methods for prediction and identification of failure modes. Design/methodology/approach: The present study in terms of objective is applied and in terms of the type of method is descriptive-analytical. The research sample included four experts of Yazd academic Libraries (Iran). To collect data, three types of questionnaires were distributed among experts. The purpose of the first questionnaire was to identify and reach an agreement on e-library failure modes. Type II questionnaire was used to determine the importance of identified risk factors and Type III questionnaire was used to prioritize the factors. Findings: Results indicate that the difficulty of using websites, lack of provided information feedback to users and lack of links on the website to users' are the main priorities for improving ESQ in the studied academic libraries. Originality/value: In this approach, the Intuitionistic fuzzy Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution method were used to rank failure modes in academic library ESQ within the FMEA framework.] © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Various decision-making problems that occur in the process of sporting event management can be formulatedas multi-criteria issues and solved by appropriate methods. One of them is choosing the best, the most suitablehost city for sporting event. On the one hand, organisingsuch an event, especially a large one, is consideredas an opportunity for the hosting area, both the cityand the country. In addition to image promotion, integrating people, increasing the sport cultureand recognition on an international stage, it provides many economic benefits, for instance increased employment, additional tourist income, trade boost and direct investments leading to urban development.On the other hand, hosting a sporting event is a huge and costlyundertaking. Thus, countries and cities wishing to do that have to prove that they are well qualified to be a host. In the location selection process the following factors may be considered: economy and finance, infrastructure, safety and security, experience with sporting events, access and lodging, environment and meteorology, and many others. Bearing that in mind as well as some controversial decisions from the past, for example those regarding the choice of Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups, it is extremely important to select the host city properly, in the most transparent and effective waypossible. To do that, multi-criteria decision aiding methods can be used.The goal of this article is to carry out a simulation of the host city selection decision, using multi-criteria outranking techniques, based on the 20th edition of the World Athletics Championships, which are scheduled to be held in 2025. © JPES.},

abstract={Purpose: For a nation to become a superpower, it's scientific and technological advancement is essential. Each country is exploring how to improve themselves in terms of science and technology. The authors analyzed the innovation capabilities of 35 OECD countries that have not recently joined Lithuania. Design/methodology/approach: In recent years, a lot of research work has been done on trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TIT-2 FS), and many research works have been published. The trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set helps effectively to represent the uncertainty comparatively than the type-1 fuzzy set. Taking advantage of this effectiveness, the authors extend the best multi-criteria decision making method (MCDM) for trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Here, ELimination and Choice Expressing REality III (ELECTRE III) method in the trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set environment is proposed. Findings: This analysis helps to the OECD countries to develop their level of innovation in the criteria. The authors are making this evaluation for the year 2018 based on the 31 criteria. Application of the proposed method expressed by evaluation of the national innovation capability problem. Based on the obtained results, the top five countries are United States, Switzerland, Canada, Germany and Japan. Originality/value: The authors collected required data from different available data sources like OECD, IMD, USPTO, ITU and surveyed data reported by KISTEP. After collecting all the data from different sources, the authors calculated the standard values as KISTEP. After converting the standard values into trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy values, the authors construct a decision matrix based on these values. Then, the authors determined the possibility mean values and preference. Then, they calculated the concordance and discordance credibility degree values. Finally, they ranked OECD countries by the net credibility degree. The results are computed by using the MATLAB software. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The ELECTRE I approach is integrated with the VIKOR method by considering intuitionistic fuzzy environments. This work introduces a novel form of representing how informed judgements affect the performance of alternatives with respect to attributes at different times that take the form of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). The proposal incorporates three different relative weights: the first is for the decision makers, the second is for the attributes in each range of time, and the last is for the time intervals themselves. The method is suitable for complex and conflicting scenarios, and how an expert's opinion changes over an interval of time is accurately described. An evaluation of the sustainability indicators for renewable energy systems is provided as an illustrative example. To validate the results, a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with existing methods are presented. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Amazon region has the largest hydrographic basin in the world and a favorable geographical location as a strategic export point but does not satisfactorily exploit its potential for transport and cargo flow, mainly as a differential factor of logistic competitiveness. For the waterway mode, cargo transportation is predominantly carried out by pushed convoys. The objective of this research is to evaluate and select, the best river train for the outflow of iron ore on the Marabá - Vila do Conde stretch, through a multiple criteria decision-making approach. To meet the objectives, a methodological framework is proposed using a hybrid AHP-DEMATEL method, based on a statistical analysis and to guarantee the reliability of the results for the proposed alternatives and not only considering the preference function, the ELECTRE method was used and also a parametric comparison of the AHP results. The main goals of this work were achieved and it was possible to infer that the combination of these methods has, in addition to the evident efficacy, a high reliability in the water transport area, being able to be used with accuracy of diverse forms in the academic area, as well as in industrial applications. Therefore, it can be affirmed that the best-pushed convoy configuration for the iron ore runoff in the Marabá - Vila do Conde stretch is composed by six barges in the arrangement of two columns and three rows with the measurements, by barge, with length of 60.96m; beam of 13.75m; and a 5m molded depth. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Trigeneration systems with Thermal storage (CCHP-TS) allow a distributed generation of energy. They also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by producing electricity, heating, and cooling from the same fuel. Current research targets their operational performance and feasibility. Nevertheless, expressing these concepts into standard criteria could foster their adoption by investors and policy-makers. This paper finds some rules of thumb for the technical and economic feasibility of CCHP-TS systems. The analysis comprises 600 scenarios, assessing the impact of different levels of spark spread (SS) rate and load size of Electricity, Heating, and Cooling. The methodology first optimizes the energy system with DER-CAM and after analyzes the output data through the clustering method k-means and the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making method ELECTRE 1S. Moreover, the paper proposes the dominance load rates to quantify the relative size of electricity, heating and cooling loads. The results show that for high SS rates, the percentage of savings improves with the dominance of electric loads. While for small SS rates, the improvement comes from the equilibrium of loads. Furthermore, for any SS, a high dominance of electricity promotes the use of Absorption and Cooling Storage, reducing the Heat Scrap. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, the partnerships between private companies and public organizations are becoming key elements for improving local development, territorial competitiveness, and delivering innovation. These collaborations are widely promoted by the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation thanks to the provision of several instruments, such as Horizon 2020. In this context, competitiveness’s improvement of the territory employing research and innovation actions is supported by the technological districts. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district has attempted a strategic action named “Call for ideas” in order to design its own roadmap for research and innovation in the agri-food sector. For this purpose, many proponents of public and/or private sectors presented several innovative project ideas referred to specific Technological Trajectories. This paper aims at providing an instrument able to select the most suitable project ideas in order to constitute the AgroBioPesca projects portfolio. To such an aim, the authors propose the application of the multiple criteria sorting method ELECTRE TRI considering criteria deduced by the Horizon 2020 guidelines and documents. The application of this methodology allows subdividing the project ideas received into project ideas to be rejected, reviewable, and eligible for funding. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty of the decision-makers’ judgment, the authors propose a new version of the method in which the crisp judgment is converted into an interval. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted to study the weaknesses of non-financiable projects. © 2019 Editora Mundos Sociais. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Lean manufacturing applies systematic strategies and tools to eliminate wastes and non-value-added activities in all the functions during manufacturing practice. Similarly, minimizing the consumption of material, energy and other natural resources while preserving the environment are the primary focus of sustainable philosophy. The synergy of these two strategies is the need of the hour in order to survive as a manufacturer as well as to achieve sustainability for the industry. The objective of this paper is to present a method of assessment and prioritization of conjoint tools to effectively implement lean and sustainable manufacturing simultaneously using a hybrid of two decision making tools. A multi-criteria decision making tool based on outranking approach, ELECTRE-II (ELimination and Choice Expressing/Translating REality) is implemented for the selection of lean tools in the order of their rankings for achieving sustainability in manufacturing. A case study of a manufacturing industry is presented to illustrate the approach. © 2019, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

abstract={In recent past, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) have increased significantly due to their various advantages to environment. With the proper charging and discharging of EVs with vehicle-to-grid (V2G), electrical system can get controllable storage/generations and at the same time, EV owners can earn profits. This paper presents a novel dispatch strategy to determine, when and at what rate EV battery should charge/discharge in order to maximize profits to EV owners and responding to power system’s requirements while considering the effect of renewable DG power availability. This objective depends on many criteria like buying and selling price of energy, battery state of charge (SoC), Renewable DG power availability, and load leveling. To solve these, a new multi-criteria decision analysis method, Probabilistic Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (p-ELECTRE), is developed. The proposed optimal dispatch strategy is applied to 100 and 200 EV fleets with random travel plan. Further, the effect of these fleets with optimal dispatch strategy is tested on IEEE 33 bus distribution system with added DGs. Furthermore, optimal power dispatch of DGs in EV-rich distribution system is obtained by BAT optimization algorithm (BOA). The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed technique. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 concept is a needed perspective for both manufacturing and service factories. In transitional period it requires big investments both for small and medium enterprises which represent a significant challenge. To make the transition as straightforward as possible, the readiness factor should be calculated before generating the investment plan. Readiness factor can provide an overview of the current state of affairs within the company and to point out where changes in operational policy and internal processes are needed. There are several methods already for the readiness factor evaluation, which provide the general overview of the company, based on the features of the previous three industrial paradigms, rather than providing a more detailed breakdown. There are many influences affecting the readiness factor, which motivates the use of multi criteria decision support systems for readiness factor evaluation. Since there are various multi criteria optimization methods , the most commonly used ones are outlined herein, such as Analytic Hierarchy Process, Promethee, Electre and TOPSIS, and are compared in terms of implemented methodologies, goal definitions, interpretation of results, and benefits and challenges. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the expansion in the quantity of cell phone utilization, mobile applications are developing significantly in today’s high-tech environment. With this high demand, the quality of mobile applications is turning into a major issue. The organizations are still finding a way to develop quality applications. The number of quality models has already been proposed for assessing the quality of a mobile application but none of them provide a holistic view towards quality assurance. The present research work proposes an empirical evaluation of the SQM-MApp quality model using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach named ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality) (ELECTRE-TRI) method and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method for ranking and determining weights of chosen quality factors respectively.

abstract={Purpose: In this paper, the authors focus on training as a frequently used knowledge management tool. This paper aims to help training function to achieve excellence at the first attempt by evaluating and deciding on the most interesting method for each training action before engaging the investment. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply instructional theories to evaluate the relevance of training methods and explored the multiple criteria decision analysis methods, which is a mathematical approach, for the evaluation to be rational. An experimental research based on study cases is also presented to test the applicability and effectiveness of the model proposed. Findings: A decisional model that allows to choose rationally the most appropriate training method for each case. It is based on Elicitation and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE I) method, which is a multi-criteria decision analysis method and uses criteria from First Principles developed by Merrill in 2002. Practical implications: The proposed model may have several implications for the improvement of training performance, particularly in the context of quality management systems that require product compliance based on continuous improvement and risk-based approaches. It can, therefore, be used as a tool to control the quality of training process or control the risk relative to the execution of a training action or more generally as a tool to “check” that training methods chosen are the most appropriate to attempt the training objectives before “act” the training action. Originality/value: The combination of a decision analysis system with the theory of instruction and the applicability to training process management. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper reports on the research techniques of application of Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) for the placement of surface flow constructed wetland (CW) in the tile-drained land. It points out that such applications are quite rare for managing diffused pollution from agricultural catchments and conventional MCA techniques have to account for advances of Geographical Information Systems. The objective of this paper was to present the methodology of MCA procedure and to test its effectiveness for the selection of sites. A case study is presented of the application of MCA based on the ELECTRE method that resulted in solving two tasks: 1) identification of the most pollution affected agricultural catchment out of three candidates, as characterised by 14 relevant criteria, and 2) placement of a pilot CW in the best site out of six in an intensively drained agricultural area as characterised by 19 criteria. For both cases, the criteria were clustered into three groups. To select the most appropriate site for siting a CW, soil-related, technically-related and pollution-related groups were identified. Based on a variety of numerical indices, the sites were ranked. A sensitivity analysis of the results when individual or group values of the weights are changed confirmed the robustness of the model. It should be stressed that conventional MCA is a powerful tool for selecting CW sites at a local level. The research techniques described here may be a good reference for developing other wetland placement systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={ELECTRE TRI, a family of multi-criteria methods used to sort alternatives into preference-ordered categories, defines an outranking function to measure the membership degree of an alternative to a category, whenever imprecise evaluations are available. Recent extensions use Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFS) to consider uncertain evaluations. However, deterministic parameters are considered, which avoids the application to cases in which non-fuzzy scores and unstable parameters are available. In this study, an approach is proposed for: 1) modeling hesitant outranking functions originated from unstable parameters provided by several DMs; 2) using the HFS to calculate the ELECTRE TRI-C indices; 3) reducing the DMs cognitive effort when they are asked to provide information. An application to supplier development is presented by using ELECTRE TRI-C. Results are compared by using different HFS aggregation operators and sensitivity analysis shows that a robust conclusion can be obtained. Future lines of research are also suggested. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To perform maintenance, the prioritization of sectors on power distribution networks still has been a challenge for managers and maintenance engineers. It should consider relevant aspects of the sectors, such as population density, the number of hospitals, and the number of schools, among others. In order to guarantee facilities reliability, this paper presents a proposal for this problematic by developing a Load Areas-sorting methodology to improve maintenance decisions on power distribution networks. It uses multi-criteria approach; characterizing criteria and weights. The initial phase of the methodology was concerned with defining of relevant operational criteria, suggested by the literature, as well as admitting new criteria that the decision makers may be deemed necessary in each scenario. The main objective was the obtaining comparison parameters to determine critical Load Areas by the occurrence of failures and allocate these areas in priority classes. An application was performed by collecting data from an electric power company in Brazil. For this application, the classes suggested were: High, Medium, and Low priority. Thus, each Load Area was allocated in a priority status regarding its importance to the company and community. The multi-criteria method used in this phase was ELECTRE TRI.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for visual-aided ontology-based multidimensional ranking and to demonstrate a case study in the academic domain. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a method for adapting semantic web technologies on multiple criteria decision-making algorithms to endow to them dynamic characteristics. It also showcases the enhancement of the decision-making process by visual analytics. Findings: The semantic enhanced ranking method enables the reproducibility and transparency of ranking results, while the visual representation of this information further benefits decision makers into making well-informed and insightful deductions about the problem. Research limitations/implications: This approach is suitable for application domains that are ranked on the basis of multiple criteria. Originality/value: The discussed approach provides a dynamic ranking methodology, instead of focusing only on one application field, or one multiple criteria decision-making method. It proposes a framework that allows integration of multidimensional, domain-specific information and produces complex ranking results in both textual and visual form. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) consists in choosing, ranking or sorting alternatives belonging to a finite set and evaluated according to several and usually conflicting criteria. Criteria weights play a crucial role in the decision process since they express the importance of the considered criteria as seen by the decision maker (DM). However, these weight values assigned directly by the DM are subjective and little reliable as they are based only on his experience, his intuition and his psychological state. To overcome the subjectivity problem, several methods are developed to infer criteria weights from DM judgments. The aim of this paper is to develop an approach eliciting ELECTRE I criteria weights using binary outranking relations furnished by the decision-maker and taking support on mathematical programming. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The evaluation to sports teaching effect of college students has very important theoretical significance and practical value. For this reason, a novel evaluation technology to the sports teaching effect of college students is constructed based on an improved ELECTRE method. There are sixteen indexes in the proposed performance evaluation indexes, which can be classified into twelve categories, six of them are motivation factors and other six are hygiene factors. In the improved ELECTRE method, concordance index, non-concordance index, credibility index, consistent credibility, non-consistent credibility and net credibility are defined firstly, and the preference matrix, the relation of group individuals are also defined. Based on these definitions, it can be sorted for the quality of all alternatives according to the net credibility. Experimental results suggest that the proposed improved ELECTRE method is feasible and valid to the sports teaching effect evaluation of college students.

abstract={The following article presents a review on the state of the art five basic criteria that a decision maker in the Supply Chain (SC) should consider in selecting carriers for the supply channel with suppliers and for channel distribution with distributors: opportunity, flexibility, cost savings, efficiency / productivity and technology. These are validated to a case study of SC Colombian green coffee, through the technical outranking multicriteria decision (ELECTRE), which seeks Carriers Selection (CS) under criteria. One of the contributions of this research is the methodology for decision making from building criteria from the literature to the application of ELECTRE technique. The second contribution to the decision maker in any SC is that he could take the code developed in Matlab and run at any time as making support organizational, logistical or production decisions, for any problem of selection, classification and prioritization. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Now-a-days in world competitive market Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method are getting more and more popular for selecting the best alternatives among the available alternative used in our problem definition. Various companies are required some core competences in order to be able to compete with numerous competitors in industries and sustain their situation in such a market. It is impossible for a company to successfully produce low-cost, high-quality products and maximize company revenue without satisfactory supplier. Companies achieve this target are those which their processes perform great and exploit from competitive price, quality and guarantee etc. Since some parameters such as price, delivery time and quality are so dependent on the performance of company supply chain management. So the result can highly impress the final price and quality of products. One of the main process of supply chain management is supplier selection process which its accurate implementation can dramatically increase company competitiveness. This process is an unstructured and complicated, involving qualitative and quantitative multi-criteria, problem of purchasing management in supply chain. In present article five different MCDM method including ELECTRE, Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), TOPSIS, Weight Product Matrix (WPM) and Lexicographic are applied on a specific problem to find out potential supplier among the numerous conflicting suppliers.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to implement a methodology based on stakeholder's judgment with assistance of fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods to assess the environmental impact. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used as a multi-level decision-making tool taking into consideration human evaluation; it captures the vagueness in ordinal judgments obtained from stakeholder's filled questionnaires and translates them into priorities which are not vague. Fuzzy ELECTRE III, known as the elimination and choice translating reality method is employed to opt for a solution to mitigate the assessed impacts. Soil, underground, surface water, underground water, air, aquatic ecology, terrestrial ecology, public health, view, economy are the ten sub-criteria used in environmental impact assessment, they are subject to the appreciations of six stakeholders groups which represent the main decision makers (DM): neighbors, enterprises, keys actors, state departments, medias and research institutions. The set of alternatives comprises the creation of a new landfill site, creation of a new ringroad, installation of a recycling unit, installation of a lixiviat unit, installation of a biogas unit and soil stabilization. The use of combined Stakeholder's analysis, Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy ELECTRE III are the distinguishing features of this paper, they form an integrated decision aiding framework that constitutes its novelty. It is applied on the linguistic judgments values to assess the environmental impact. This work proposes an integrated decision-making approach applied in the case study of the urban waste landfill of Tangier city in north Morocco.},

abstract={To evaluate solutions of power distribution system planning (PDSP) is an essential task in smart grid and requires multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). However, the vagueness of attribute values and the fuzziness of weights of criteria need integrate fuzzy techniques with MCDM. In order to incorporate the issues with uncertainty in PDSP evaluation, this paper proposes a novel PDSP approach based on linear programming model and ELECTRE IIL The incomplete weight preference information of decision-maker is elicited and expressed by a group of weight constraint functions, combined these functions with the simple multi-attribute rating technique, a linear programming model is set up to obtain the weights for each solution. Then with the weights and a PDSP model based on ELECTRE III model, the outranking score of each solution compared with other solutions can be calculated, and a net present score for each solution will be obtained for ranking these solutions, DM can choose one desired. A case is demonstrated to show the evaluation process using this approach and the results indicate that this approach incorporating the issues with uncertainty is robust for PDSP evaluation. The results are acceptable to DM. © 2014 IEEE.},

Usually, the country performance on these criteria is calculated based on historical data and indexes provided by international institutions. Due to the continuous changes in economic trends, the volatile data could not be sufficient to make an optimal investment decision and thus experts? assertions are essential. In this paper, we propose a multiple criteria decision making methodology to build a ranking on the attractiveness of the Northern African countries (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania) for foreign direct investment from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The proposed approach is a novelty extended version of the ELECTRE IV where expert?s judgment on the investment environment is based on an imprecise Likert scale which allows us to consider partial information on expert?s opinion. © 2015 INFOR Journal.},

abstract={Flood management alternatives are investigated based on sustainable development criteria (SDC) by using a non-compensatory multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model, ELECTRE-III, to reduce flood damage in a study reach of the Gorganrood River in Golestan Province, north of Iran. The selection of optimal alternative of flood management is a multi-objective issue and thus using MCDM models becomes necessary. Considering the physical, social and economic conditions of the region, a set of structural and non-structural alternatives is proposed for the flood management in the study reach of the Gorganrood River. To model sustainable development, 11 criteria are proposed for decisions regarding flood management considering benefits to future generation. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in thresholds and ratings of alternatives. The results show that a non-compensatory MCDM model is appropriate to incorporate social, economic and environmental criteria for the ranking of flood management alternatives. In addition, ranking alternatives is sensitive to changes in the weights of criteria. Nevertheless, in spite of sensitive weights, the best alternative remained unchanged. The optimal decision achieves an integrated alternative of flood warning system and flood insurance based on the sustainable development concept.},

abstract={In order to increase efficiency and improve competitiveness, manufacturers around the globe are focusing on developing their core businesses. On the other hand, standard activities of engineering are optimally accomplished outside the borders of the firm; thus outsourcing of non-core businesses has become lately a common practice. Product design is considered as one of the most important phases in a product's life cycle, since the majority of most critical decisions in terms of products' overall performance are considered during the Research & Development (R&D) phase. Involving suppliers in a firm's R&D offers significant benefits in various directions, such as feasibility, practicability, sustainability, competitiveness and innovativeness. However, selecting the optimal outsourcing strategy is not an easy decision. On the contrary, it is most challenging since it encompasses a number of different and in many cases mutually conflicting criteria. This paper presents a methodological approach for the selection of the optimal outsourcing strategy for a manufacturer's R&D. The methodology is based on outranking multicriteria methods and more specifically ELECTRE III. The approach is illustrated and validated through a real world case study of a Greek olive oil producer.},

This indicator is often used to support decisions, but its relevance is intensified when measurements are taken at detailed levels. In this context, this study sets out to calculate the Municipal Human Development Index for 5,507 municipalities in Brazil. As a result, cities were classified into four development levels. Among Brazilian cities, 2.63% were classified as having a very high human development; 25.48% as high; 33.14% as medium; and 38.75% as low. The classification of approximately 54% of the municipalities was changed. The new approach enabled areas to be classified in a way that was more faithful to reality, without considering that half the population lives with a high quality of life. The multicriteria method ELECTRE TRI-C was used to mitigate some criticism of the index. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The successful selection or prioritization of Information System (IS) projects is critical for organizations in the current competitive environment. Moreover, the inadequacy of traditional quantitative cost-benefit analysis for evaluating IS projects has led researchers to propose other models, most of which are based on a multicriteria method. Indeed, the IS project prioritization problem has a multidimensional nature and the use of multicriteria decision aiding (MCDA) methods is a clever way to solve this problem. This paper proposes a model for prioritizing IS projects which makes use of the ELECTRE IV multicriteria method so as to rank stakeholders' preferences regarding IS projects, and of the Copeland's method, to aggregate these preferences into a single structure that represents the decision of the group of stakeholders. The application of this decision model is illustrated by a case study of how IS projects were prioritized at a glass packaging factory. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an evaluation method of the state of real estate properties as a first step towards the elaboration of action plans for improving the environmental characteristics of a building stock. This multicriteria and multilevel evaluation method takes into account both the decision maker and the building specialists' point of views. One of the main challenges is in the translation of data obtained from tools such as life cycle analysis, thermal simulation or global cost analysis into high level information meaningful to the decision maker. This paper focuses on the transition mechanisms of the evaluations between the two types of actors. The proposed method is based on the comparisons of data with reference values and on multicriteria aggregation using ELECTRE TRI. We illustrate the working of the proposed method on a building stock example. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This article describes the development of a decision support tool based on multicriteria analysis, which uses the results of a risk analysis to evaluate and compare risk reduction measures. The literature contains a wide range of risk analysis techniques and we used the combined risk analysis method that is often used in water distribution systems. The multicritera decision analysis employed considers five of the methods most often applied to water resources problems: weighted sum, TOPSIS, ELECTRE I and III, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A method was developed that integrates the risk and multicriteria decision analysis applicable to a water distribution network. The main steps of this approach are: first, to identify the pipes that are expected to be more constraining, i.e. pipes with a relatively high probability of failing and/or producing an extreme effect in the event of failure; second, to consider measures which could reduce the likelihood and/or consequences of the occurrence of these events; third, to analyse these measures through multicriteria decision analysis to identify the most effective technical and economic solution.

In order to reduce the sensitivity of the decision results deriving from the index weight coefficient change, the analytic hierarchy process based on the model of index weights in SPA has been used to improve the reliability of the results of the decision-making to a certain extent.

abstract={The service models of cloud computing include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Multi-tenancy service is one service concept of a SaaS. A tenant can customize personal requirements in a multi-tenancy service configuration by negotiating with the service provider. The configuration items are recorded in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Due to the popularity of software services, there are various services for the tenant to choose from. How to select a reasonable service from various multi-tenancy services has become an important issue. Therefore, this research explores the utility function of the SLA and uses an approach for the optimal selection of a multi-tenancy service based on a SLA utility function. The approach formalizes the SLA and discusses a utility model for the SLA's configuration items. Then, the multi-criteria decision analysis method is used to discover the reasonable selection order of multi-tenancy services. The selection order helps a tenant acquire a reasonable multi-tenancy service which meets his personal requirements. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is one of the most widely used decision methodologies. Because every kind of MCDM approach has its strong point and weakness, it is hard to make sure that what kind of MCDM approach is suitable to a specific problem. Therefore, a new decision making method is proposed in this paper based on linguistic information and intersection concept which is called linguistic intersection method (LIM). The linguistic variables are used to express the opinion of each decision-maker. There are four MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, and VIKOR are included in the linguistic intersection method. First, each MCDM approach is used to determine the ranking order of all alternatives in accordance with the linguistic evaluations by decision-makers. And then, the intersection set is determined for the better alternatives of all methods. Third, the final ranking order of alternatives in the intersection set can be determined by the proposed method. This study presented an example to implement and compare the proposed method with individual linguistic MCDM method. Finally, some conclusions and future research will be discussed at the end of this paper. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={There are several methods for Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) such as multiple attribute utility theory (MAUT), the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and Fuzzy AHP. However, these methods are compensatory optimization approaches for which bad score on some criteria can be compensated by excellent scores on other criteria. So, the Elimination and Choice Translating Reality III (ELECTRE III) was proposed to solve such problem. Nevertheless, thresholds determined by identified experts and used in this method may be inconsistent. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach which employs ELECTRE III and partial concepts of AHP together, called the Consistency ELECTRE III. In this method, ELECTRE III is used in ranks the alternatives and AHP is used in determining the consistency of the criteria thresholds within ELECTRE III. In the simulation, it is found that threshold values of criteria within ELECTRE III affect the ranking of the alternatives. Specially, the ranking of the Consistency ELECTRE III and that of the ELECTRE III are different. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The multicriteria decision aid method ELECTRE III was proposed as the decision tool for the choice of the most compromised variant. The proposed method was used for a case study calculation - the choice of an integrated heating-cooling system for an office building. Copyright 2010 Air & Waste Management Association.},

This integrated approach starts by investigating and describing the system of sustainable oriented goals of each decision makers working on an urban project. By modeling the final objectives in the form of tree structure, one obtains the reference frame which will make it possible to evaluate a sustainable performance for each decision maker. Then we will use a specific algebra to merge the tree structure of each actor of the decision process into a generic tree structure. Next we build criteria (indicators of sustainability) to represent each objective. Each criterion is provided with standard values to define various distances to the objective. Lastly, by incorporating the criteria on any level of the tree structure, and by using the Electre-Tri aggregation method, it is proposed an evaluation of each objective. A computer tool baptized Impact is embedding these various techniques. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The scientists make experiments to affirm their hypothesies (this experiments are tests in research) or to choose the best from available possibilities (this experiments are valuations in research). We have two basis principles which we must respect in one experiments planning: random choice and repeatition but exists and the third - called local control. Namely, before the beginning of one experiment, it is necessary to examine the influence on on the experiments error in advance known and possible be local controlled parameters and their set apart from experiment error. In some experiment organization, like agricultural and other biological experiments, it is especially important to have good plane because they can be repeated after long period, often only next year. Mathematical instruments of most effective planes for experiment organization are possible to search on the basis of total random distribution, random block distribution and especially in balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) while they can most effectively represent one or multifactorial experiments in which participate finite number of different elements-treatments which should be organised in some blocks of defined number so that every of this elements are in smaller number blocks and every pair of this elements is in necessary number of blocks. It is very comlicated to make statistical analysis for experiment planes based on the BIBDs like analysis of variance and therefore authors propose one new possiblity like multi criteria analysis decision application in analysis of experiment results. It is know that exist two basis groups of multi criteria decision methods and that: multi target and multi attribute methods and in each of this two groups have a few methods. In this paper authors propose one subgroup of this - ELECTRE(or PROMETHEE) method which is from the group of multi attribute group of multi criteria decision methods. One example of both application, multi criteria analysis and analysis of variance, in experiment organization is given on the end of this paper.},

The main reason is linked to the methodology of the studies in the design phase. The process is neither adapted to the complexity of the decision-making task, nor to a general management of the wastewater sewerage in a territory. In order to make these studies more coherent and the choices more rational, we propose a new formulation of the methodology as an alternative to the current one. Our approach relies on decision-making support which borrows concepts from expert systems and multicriteria analysis in order to structure the reasoning process and to take into account the very different criteria a real decision-making task often implies.We show that this support has to be interactive and iterative in order to ensure that coherent and relevant solutions are chosen. © IWA Publishing 2002.},

From this comparison, principles are derived in order to translate the asynchronous Electre programs into the common code of the reactive languages (using the Esterel synchronous language). Furthermore, the idea of a mixed programming style is presented. It makes it possible to write programs consisting with a synchronous part together with an asynchronous part. Some aspects of this new approach called ambisynchronism are illustrated through an example. © 1996 IEEE.},

abstract={Programming in ESTEREL a large real-time application with various specific problems issued from the domain of applications (automatic manufacturing process) shows the problem of an asynchronous reality opposed to a synchronous expression. Since the application has an asynchronous nature and the language was synchronous, we therefore searched to develop systematic methods to adapt synchronous programming to asynchronous context. In order to help us and to define accurately the problems, we classified the events by their nature so as to find a systematic implementation for each class. We found systematic solutions for most of the problems but some persist and look like a shadow over the programmer who wants to use ESTEREL. If memorizing the state of a component is no more a problem, controlling the number of states produced by the compiler remains one. The programmer will always be haunt by the risk to make the automaton explose but, maybe, he is better driven than before. This study comes within the framework of the development of the ELECTRE language we designed. ELECTRE is a reactive language which is intended to the expression of asynchronous applications. That is to say: -actions have a no-null execution duration and they may be either resumed or restarted and they may be assigned a non-interruptible property - events are complex entities which may be assigned properties so that either they are fleeting or they have single or multiple occurrences memorization. Moreover, its operational semantics makes it possible to compile the ELECTRE programs into Finite State Automata. We are currently working on the translation from ELECTRE to ESTEREL. © 1991, Springer Verlag. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Describes a two part procedure for ranking projects based on an entropy method for assigning weights to criteria and the ELECTRE method of ranking projects. In the entropy method scores on each criteria were normalised, expressed as decimal proportions, and then used to calculate entropy weights. In the example the weight for tourist visitors was much larger than those for population served, incomes, time savings etc. These weights were then used to re- scale normalised scores as a decision matrix for the ELECTRE procedure, which uses the weighted normalised scores to create a directed graph from which alternatives may be ranked.-A.Hay},

abstract={In recent years, multi-criteria sorting problems have become an interesting topic for researchers working on multi-criteria decision-making. ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE)-TRI and FlowSort are well-known approaches suggested for such a classification. The current study aimed to implement ELECTRE-TRI and FlowSort methods in the stock portfolio selection (SPS) as one of the most popular and important decision-making subjects and compare the outcomes of each method to understand how these methods perform in SPS problems. In this study, the best–worst method was applied to determine the weights of criteria. Four approaches for ELECTRE-TRI and 15 approaches for FlowSort were considered. Finally, 19 different approaches were considered to select stocks from a large pool of stocks. Results indicated that the model parameter should be properly defined to minimize inconsistencies and improve the power of the model. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets represent a successful generalization of Pythagorean fuzzy sets that embeds the benefits of hesitation. As such they enable the practitioner to incorporate vague data and information very effectively. We take advantage of this feature in the procedure of risk evaluation in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). This technique has demonstrated to be a powerful and valuable framework for the identification of possible failures and the reduction of their occurrence. The advantages of hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets motivate us to extend the existing methods of risk assessment in FMEA to the case where data are in that format. Therefore, we propose an ELimination and Choice Translating REality-I (ELECTRE-I) approach under the hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy (HPF) environment to measure and rank risks. To assess the failures, the HPF ELECTRE-I technique creates hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy concordance/discordance matrices. Then, we use an outranking decision graph to obtain the most crucial failure mode. We illustrate the structure of this procedure through a flow chart. Furthermore, the model is validated through the study of real-life applications, such as the prevention of infant abduction and risk evaluation of health care failure modes in blood transfusion. Finally, to showcase the superiority and effectiveness of the suggested method, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the HPF ELECTRE-I approach with existing techniques. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Recent years have seen a rapid development in industrialization and urbanization with a huge growth in the population throughout the world. In this regard, an efficient and robust decision-making framework for the concept of a green city and sustainable development goals to manage municipal plastic wastes is still needed. This study models a bio-recovery of municipal different plastic wastes management based on a new integrated Multi-Criterion Decision-Making (MCDM) approach through a case study in Mashahd, Iran. The proposed integrated MCDM framework includes the Shannon Entropy (SE), Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and, ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) systems in an intelligent way. Through decision-making computations, all criteria are approved after extraction from the literature review by experts with more than 60% agreement percentage. Different scenarios of economic, energy, and environmental crises are created. One finding of this paper is to propose a new entrance in economic competition with plastic biodegradation to present a novel, environmental-friendly product with high-quality and low-cost advantages. Another finding determines that with an application of plastic wastes bio-recovery, citizens' satisfaction from urban management system will be increased from 49% to 64%. Whereas, based on the outcomes of this investigation, the rate of municipal waste industries development, smart city goals’ meeting, and rate of hazardous material emission from municipal solid wastes are increased to 58%, 25%, and 70%, respectively. The declared numerical outcomes illustrate the effectiveness of plastic waste bio-recovery on the smart city concept. © 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry},

abstract={In this paper, we present (to the best of our knowledge) the first outranking method to assign a score to each alternative. This method is part of the ELECTRE family, and we will call it ELECTRE-SCORE. In contrast to the Multi-Attribute Value Theory methods, ELECTRE-SCORE does not construct a value function for each criterion to proceed then to the aggregation into a single value. Instead, ELECTRE-SCORE makes use of the outranking relations to make a comparison with sets of reference actions (to which a score is assigned) and assigns a score range to each action and a representative score in the range to each action. This is a more robust way of proceeding given the fragility of a single score. The reference actions have similar nature and characteristics of limiting profiles in ELECTRE TRI-NB and the reference scores are assigned to them through the application of the deck of cards technique. Because this method uses outranking relations, it makes also possible to take into account the imperfect knowledge of data and to avoid systematic compensatory effects. Some fundamental theoretical results guaranteeing the consistency of the method, an illustrative example and a case study in the domain of healthcare system evaluation are also provided in this paper. © 2021 The Authors},

This paper provides a model for assessing project attractiveness levels and deciding whether to submit a proposal. The model introduces a classification model that incorporates fuzzy preferential information to evaluate project attractiveness under multiple dimensions and enables the decision-maker to make more effective decisions. Projects are assigned to ordinal categories of attractiveness based on an adapted fuzzy ELECTRE TRI-C procedure. The main advantages of this model are that the attractiveness level can be used as an input for the bidding strategies, the attractiveness evaluation can support the contractor in prioritizing the projects to bid on, and the model captures the decision process's subjective assessments and situations of imprecision observed on early phases of the project life cycle. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={As the destructive impacts of both human-made and natural disasters on societies and built environments are predicted to increase in the future, innovative disaster management strategies to cope with emergency conditions are becoming more crucial. After a disaster, selecting the most critical post-disaster reconstruction projects among available projects is a challenging decision due to resource constraints. There is strong evidence that the success of many post-disaster reconstruction projects is compromised by inappropriate decisions when choosing the most critical projects. Therefore, this study presents an integrated approach based on four multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) techniques, namely, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE, to aid decision makers in prioritizing post-disaster projects. Furthermore, an aggregation approach (linear assignment) is used to generate the final ranking vector since various methods may provide different outcomes. In the first stage, 21 criteria were determined based on sustainability. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, the obtained results were compared to the results of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, which was applied to predict the projects’ success rates. A case study was used to assess the application of the proposed model. The obtained results show that in the selected case, the most critical criteria in post-disaster project selection are quality, robustness, and customer satisfaction. The findings of this study can contribute to the growing body of knowledge about disaster management strategies and have implications for key stakeholders involved in post-disaster reconstruction projects. Furthermore, this study provides valuable information for national decision makers in countries that have limited experience with disasters and where the destructive consequences of disasters on the built environment are increasing. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Over the last decade, the total primary energy consumption has increased from 479 × 1015 BTU in 2010 to 528 × 1015 BTU in 2020. To address this ever-increasing energy demand, as well as prevent environmental pollution, clean energies are presented as a potential solution. In this regard, evaluating and selecting the most appropriate clean energy solution for a specific area is of particular importance. Therefore, in this study, a comparative analysis in Jiangsu province in China was performed by describing and implementing five prominent multi-criteria decision-making methods in the field of energy technology selection, including SAW, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, VIKOR, and COPRAS. The decision problem here consists of four clean energy options, including solar photovoltaic, wind, nuclear, and biomass, which have been evaluated by twelve basic and important criteria for ranking clean energy options. The obtained results, according to all five MCDM methods, indicate that solar photovoltaic was the optimal option in this study, followed by wind energy. The nuclear and biomass options placed third and fourth, respectively, except in the ELECTRE method ranking, in which both options scored the same and thus neither was superior. Finally, by conducting a comprehensive two-stage sensitivity analysis, in the first stage, it was found that changes in the weights of land use and water consumption criteria had the greatest impact on the performance of options, among which biomass and nuclear showed high sensitivity to variations in criteria weights. In the second stage, by defining five scenarios, the ranking of options was evaluated from different aspects so that the decision maker/organization would be able to make appropriate decisions in different situations. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The use of renewable energy globally has shown to be one of the most promising strategies to move towards sustainable development. Biomass has become one of the world's most practical renewable energy sources. Decisions on bioenergy are difficult since the field crosses several Ministries' jurisdictions, including energy, agriculture, the environment, and industry and commerce. The biomass feedstocks are geographically and spatially distributed. Therefore, identifying and prioritizing suitable places for building expensive biomass plants is a complex problem for maximum productivity and return. This research provides an automated Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique with geographical information system (GIS) to solve the intricate nature of location identification and prioritization difficulty caused by the availability of numerous indicators, such as economic and environmental technical, social, and risk criteria. This research implements the Fuzzy-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS) method and compared the performance using standard TOPSIS, ELECTRE, and SAW methods. A standardization procedure has been applied to entail constructing an overall performance index to assess the outcomes. Eventually, the standard Pearson correlation coefficient is taken a gander at reciprocal connections amongst multi-criteria decision-making approaches. The F-TOPSIS outperforms the other methods with the highest performance ratio of 98.78%, fuel consumption ratio of 15.1%, sensitivity ratio of 92.8%, mean absolute error rate of 21.6%, mean square error rate of 23.1%, transportation cost of 25.8%, and decision-making ratio of 94.7% when compared to others.

abstract={The sustainable medical supplier selection (SMSS) is an important issue facing the medical industry in the context of sustainable development, which can be regarded as a typical multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem. In the MAGDM process, linguistic term set (LTS) is particularly natural and convenient for decision makers (DMs) to express evaluation information. Especially, probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a very critical and effective tool, which can reflect the importance of different linguistic terms. Due to the different preferences and experience of different DMs, they may use multi-granularity probabilistic linguistic term sets (MGPLTSs) to represent different linguistic information. In this article, in order to study the comparison method of MGPLTSs, a new possibility degree formula is firstly proposed and its properties is proved. Then, in order to build a weight model, a possibility degree-based Best-Worst method (BWM) and a probability degree based-maximizing deviation method are established to calculate the subjective weights and objective weights of attributes, respectively. Where after, a MAGDM method is proposed by combining the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite (ELECTRE) method with Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method in the multi-granularity probabilistic linguistic information environment. Finally, the created MAGDM method is applied to the SMSS, and its effectiveness and advantages compared with other existing methods are verified. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={This paper aims to develop a Fermatean fuzzy ELECTRE method for solving multi-criteria group decision-making problems with unknown weights of decision makers and incomplete weights of criteria. First, a new distance measure between Fermatean fuzzy sets is proposed based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The cross entropy for Fermatean fuzzy sets is defined. Three kinds of dominance relationships for Fermatean fuzzy sets are proposed. Then, two optimization models are constructed to obtain positive ideal decision-making information and negative ideal decision-making information, respectively. Accordingly, the credibility degree of each decision maker is calculated. Decision makers' dynamic weights are determined by their credibility degrees. Besides, to obtain the weights of criteria, an optimization model is constructed based on grey relational analysis for Fermatean fuzzy numbers. Finally, the strong, medium and weak Fermatean fuzzy concordance and discordance sets are identified to construct the Fermatean fuzzy concordance and discordance matrices, respectively. A practical case study is carried out to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed ELECTRE method. Comparative analyses are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed ELECTRE method. © 2022 Vilnius University.},

abstract={As more attention is given to environmental protection, sustainable development has become a hot topic for the international community and the companies are motivated to focus on reverse logistics (RL) in their operations for resource conservation and sustainability. However, many enterprises are limited by their economic strength and resources so that outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) is their best choice. Therefore, how to effectively assess and select the 3PRLP has been a crucial issue. Given that the preference and optimism of decision makers (DMs) should be exhibited, in this paper, an improved ELECTRE II method with double attitude parameters under linguistic Z-number (LZN) environment is proposed to deal with such decision problems. Firstly, the LZN is in use to describe experts’ assessments as well as the reliability of evaluations qualitatively. Then an improved ELECTRE II model based on ideal point method is presented to rank alternatives accurately, in which the main concept of ideal point method is pressed into service in determining the preference levels of alternatives and identifying the outranking relations. Meanwhile, two attitude parameters are introduced, which can express DMs’ preference for risk as well as profit and their optimism for decision making, thereby making the decision process more practical and the ranking more reasonable. Then a numerical example on the selection of 3PRLP is shown to minutely explain procedures of the presented method and a sensitivity analysis on the double attitude parameters is conducted to illustrate effects of the two indexes and verify the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, some comparisons are carried out to prove its effectiveness and meliority. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The m-polar fuzzy set is the extended form of the bipolar fuzzy set. It is helpful in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). While solving problems with actual values of various criteria, normalization methods are used to make consistent data. Uniform data is input to multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The single-valued m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I algorithm also uses normalized data as input parameters. There are different methods of normalization, which can be used to make data uniform. In this paper, with the help of the robot selection problem, we study the effect of five different normalization methods on the rank performance of the single-valued m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I algorithm. The m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I algorithm is beneficial in finding outranking relations between two alternatives. However, normalization methods affect outranking relations of other options and ultimately affect rank performance in the selection process. This study concluded in the recommendation of a suitable normalization method for the single-valued m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I method. It is supposed that linear sum (N3) and vector normalization (N4) methods are ideal for the m-polar fuzzy ELECTRE-I process to achieve consistent rank performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The focus of this paper is to define anchorage management model for concession planning purposes to provide quality support to experts in spatial planning when developing maritime spatial plans. The research aim is to develop an anchorage management model that includes decision and concession support concept. Decision support concept is defined in order to support the processes of identifying potential anchorage locations, their evaluation and comparison, and finally, the priority ranking and selection of locations for their construction. The final step is modelling the concession support concept that includes financial analysis to concession parameters definition. The problem of decision making and concession of the anchorage location selection is complex and ill-structured because of the unsystematic and ad-hoc decisions by all included stakeholders. Additionally, the involvement of several stakeholders’ groups with different preferences and background knowledge, a large amount of conflicting and seemingly incomparable information and data, and numerous conflicting goals and criteria impact final decisions. The proposed concepts overcome the above obstacles in order to enable the construction of anchorages in a way of optimal use of maritime space. The model is tested on the island of Brač, Croatia. The methods used to solve the task are SWARA (The Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) for defining the criteria weights and ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) for ranking anchorage locations. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Internal audit is an independent and objective assurance and consulting activity that aims to improve the operations of an organization and add value to them. Planning internal audit by prioritizing the units to be audit is critical in terms of effective use of available audit and financial resources. In this paper, a new ELimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) based decision support model is developed for addressing an internal audit prioritization problem. Spherical fuzzy sets are used for modeling the uncertainty in the nature of the problem and three different approaches are proposed within the study. The first approach is constructed with gradual concordance and discordance sets by comparing spherical fuzzy membership, non-membership, and hesitancy degrees of alternatives; the second approach is developed based on a single type of outranking relation obtained by utilizing score and accuracy functions of spherical fuzzy sets, and the third approach provides an increased fuzziness modeling capacity by using interval-valued spherical fuzzy sets. In the application part of the study, the units of an organization are prioritized for internal audit activity based on five components of the internationally recognized Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Sensitivity analyses for decision-maker and criterion weights and a comparative analysis with six other state-of-the-art multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models are also presented to analyze the consistency and validity of the proposed spherical fuzzy ELECTRE model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to the world health system, prompting academics and health professionals to develop appropriate solutions. Researchers reported different COVID-19 vaccines introduced by institutions and companies around the globe, which are at different stages of development. However, research developing an integrated framework for selecting and ranking the optimal potential vaccine against COVID-19 is minimal. This paper aimed to fill this gap by using a hybrid methodology based on ELimination Et Choice Translating REality III (ELECTRE III)–Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach to select the optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. ELECTRE III method yields a fathomable analysis of the concordance index, while GA is known for its ability to disaggregate decision-making preferences from holistic decisions. TOPSIS is preferred for picking an ideal and an anti-ideal solution. Thus, combining ELECTRE III-GA and TOPSIS is considered the best model to assess vaccines against the pandemic. The results confirm that the best vaccines rely on a high level of safety, efficacy, and availability. Our developed evaluation framework can help healthcare professionals and researchers gain research information and make critical decisions regarding potential vaccines against the disease. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Paratransit modes dominate the public transportation industry in the majority of developing countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa. The number of these modes has increased rapidly over the years. Authorities have not yet been able to provide a better alternative for passengers, whose demand is ever-growing. In this research, the main modes of public transport in a Sub-Saharan African city, Kampala, have been studied. Here we used multi-criteria decision-making methods to find out which among the four major public transport modes in Kampala, Uganda, are best from a transportation operator's perspective. The evaluation of alternatives was conducted using Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE III) methods. Both the ANP and the ELECTRE III analysis results demonstrate that alternative “Coaster” is the most appropriate alternative from a public transport operator's point of view. A sensitivity analysis consisting of four different scenarios was considered in the changing of weighting percentages (for benefit, cost, and risk clusters) in the ANP and the ELECTRE III analyses, to show the robustness of the ranking results. According to the sensitivity analysis results, there was no change in the final ranking.

abstract={Torrents are ephemeral streams which usually carry heavy bedload and flash flows. The frequent changes in its course caused by meandering and migration lead to extensive damage to environment in valley and alluvial land. In the present study, application programming interface (API) was developed to analyze temporal Landsat data in Google Earth Engine(GEE) to understand land use/land cover and vegetation characteristics in the Tangri (Dangri) River, India, and Indian Remote Sensing Satellites data were used for hazard and vulnerability assessment. It is observed that because of various conservation activities as well as due to watershed inhabitants’ intervention, the areas under cropland, orchard/plantation and grass/scrub have increased. The monthly mean enhanced vegetation index (EVI) has also increased in the watershed. Although, the average annual soil loss is high, i.e., 40.4 t/ha/yr. It is highest for mountain physiographic unit (67.6 t/ha/yr.) and scrub forest (61.5 t/ha/yr.). Based on flood inundation modeling, it is estimated that for two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and hundred-year return periods, 1.42–16.14% areas of watershed are likely to get inundated. Torrents’ vulnerability analysis was carried out using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to derive composite vulnerability index by aggregating weights of various parameters and sub-parameters. The alternatives for the treatment of vulnerable sections in torrential regime were evaluated using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) models.

abstract={Preventive maintenance (PM) of machines and equipment plays the critical role in a factory or an organization. It can decrease the number of failures, increase reliability, and minimize total costs of production systems. The duty of maintenance section managers is to prioritize machines and then, implement PM programs for them. Since machines have different measures with respect to the maintenance costs, reliability, mean time between failures (MTBF), availability of spare parts, etc., the machines evaluation problem can be considered as a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Accordingly, the MCDM techniques can be applied to solve them. This paper is aimed at extending a version of the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE III) method to interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) where curved membership functions (MFs) are applied. The extended ELECTRE III methodology is then utilized to a maintenance group MCDM (GMCDM) matrix including the quantitative (QNC) and qualitative criteria (QLC). In the proposed approach, the criteria weights, the assessment of alternatives with respect to criteria, and the thresholds are stated with Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy sets (GIT2FSs). In order to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach, a case study and an illustrative example are exhibited using real decision-making problems. Due to the high correlation coefficients among our method and the others, it can be considered as a valid and reliable approach to prioritize machines for PM. © 2021 Iran University of Science and Technology.

abstract={Purpose: A challenge that the road paving sector is facing concerns the achievement of highly performing bituminous asphalt mixture solutions that do not negatively impact the environment. New environmentally sound asphalt production and recycling technologies are becoming more and more widespread, but their practical application is still hindered by the lack of appropriate decision-making strategies by the administrations. In this study, innovative asphalt mixtures were compared through a novel multi-criterion and sensitivity analysis framework for selecting the best solutions. Methods: A new decision support system has been implemented to choose the best paving alternative between nine asphalt mixtures containing different marginal materials for the binder and base layer of a flexible pavement. The methodological steps taken to reach the definition of the optimal solution concerned (1) mechanical analysis of the designed asphalt mixtures by laboratory investigation, (2) calculation of life cycle assessment indicators using the ReCiPe method, (3) application of the ELECTRE method for the identification of the optimal solution on the basis of both mechanical and environmental performance considering a traditional weight vector, and (4) sensitivity analysis based on 27 different configurations of weight vectors. Results and discussion: The results of this work revealed that the hot asphalt solutions for the binder layer utilizing jet grouting waste and fly ash in substitution of natural fillers reached the best engineering and environmental performance, respectively. Between the asphalt mixtures for the base layer, the cold recycled asphalt containing reclaimed asphalt pavement and jet grouting waste reached, at the same time, the best environmental performance, the minimum value of permanent deformation, and the highest stiffness at 40 °C. The ELECTRE method and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the purpose of jet grouting for making both hot and cold solutions is the best-compromise solution of environmental and mechanical performance. Conclusions: The proposed framework allows the quantitative assessment of sustainable road asphalt pavement solutions and fits the needs of several engineering fields where a trade-off between mechanical and environmental performance of multiple construction materials must be established. Future development of this framework could include cost indicators to address the sustainability of the solutions in detail. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates the application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology in a real case study aiming to choose the best rehabilitation intervention of an industrial water main. This methodology is composed of three main stages: problem identification, structuring, and evaluation. Problem structuring, a crucial stage for the outcomes, includes identifying objec-tives, selecting scenarios within the analysis period, defining problem alternatives, and defining the problematic type. Problem evaluation includes the selection of assessment metrics, selection of the aggregation method, application of the method, and a sensitivity and robustness analysis. Two scenarios, nine assessment metrics, and seven alternatives are established, and two ranking methods (the additive model and ELECTRE III method) are used to compare the alternatives. The results show that the best solution corresponds to building a new pipe and deactivating the existing one, as it significantly reduces the pipe failure risk and O&M costs, whereas the worst solution is always the status quo case, since it is the only alternative that does not improve the system performance, independently of the ranking method and the analyzed scenario. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Software reliability is estimated using software reliability growth models. In the last few decades, numerous software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been established. Some models are developed with the consideration of perfect debugging, imperfect debugging, testing coverage, testing effort, and fault reduction factor. Generally, SRGMs are dependent on dataset and thus it is a challenging task to select SRGM appropriately based on the need of software user. As the inappropriate selection of SRGM can lead to inaccurate results and consequently delay in software release. To address this issue, we have combined the two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches namely Entropy and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) methods. The proposed approach identifies the criterion importance as to select suitable SRGM, comparison of criteria is important. The outcomes are based on the aggregate value of dominant matrix that is being used for SRGMs ranking. The working of proposed Entropy-ELECTRE method is demonstrated on a real time data set on which ten SRGMs are compared against six evaluation criteria. The findings play an important role in determining the SRGM's appropriateness for decision-maker. © 2021 Reliability: Theory and Applications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When formulating economic development strategies, the environment and society must be considered to preserve well-being. This paper proposes a comparative sustainability assessment method using environmentally extended input-output analysis and multi-criteria decision aid. Using symmetric input-output tables and sectoral CO2 emissions and employment data for six countries, linkage coefficients are calculated for 163 sectors in each country. Multi-criteria decision aid tool, ELECTRE III, is used to derive outranking relationships among each country’s sectors using these coefficients as criteria, resulting in a hierarchy of sectors ordered by sustainability. Sectors that frequently appear at the top of the six hierarchies included education, health care, construction, and financial intermediation. China’s results differ significantly because of its concentration of economic activity on the primary/secondary sectors. The results can enable identification of key intervention pathways along which sustainable development could be stimulated. Country-specific recommendations and reflections on economic and sustainability policy initiatives are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={The efficient evaluation of the transport sector for the implementation of sustainable mobility solutions is a crucial challenge for governments and decisionmakers for strategically reducing the negative economic, social, and environmental impacts of transport. Current research trends on transport macromanagement indicate a lack of integrative and comprehensive approaches to mitigating transport sustainability parameters. Thus, a holistic perspective on transport macromanagement is deemed necessary for supporting the transition towards a more sustainable approach to transport macroplanning. This paper contributes to the development of transport macromanagement by offering insights, tools, and strategies for contemporary sustainable transitions in the transport sector. A methodology for sustainable and multimodal/cross-border passenger services for the Italy-Croatia cross-border area, with a systematic development cycle composed of six interconnected steps for fostering stakeholder cooperation, is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, a methodological framework, a SWOT analysis, and a gap analysis on the function of defining port improvement for the action plan are elaborated in this study. The study analysis is based on the international passenger terminal ports in a passenger liner service by using a survey analysis conducted among the port authorities in the cross-border area. Moreover, the main aim of the methodology is to provide a holistic framework for the sustainable development of a complex and multilayered transport environment that encompasses a multiplicity of various stakeholders. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={ELECTRE III is a well-known multiple criteria decision aiding method based on pairwise comparisons. However, it cannot be applied to ranking problems involving many alternatives, because the number of pairwise comparisons can then be rather large. In this paper, we present an evolution-based approach for exploiting large fuzzy outranking relations and deriving a crisp outranking relation with desirable properties. Therefore, the utilization of a fuzzy outranking relation is modeled as a three-objective optimization problem, which is solved by an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed ranking algorithm is a hybrid of the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and a reference point method with the repeated use of a choice mechanism. In addition, a method that portrays the obtained ranking in a Hasse diagram is used for recommendation purposes. We designate the new method RP2-NSGA-II+H. In our experiments, the proposed ranking procedure demonstrates a better performance in terms of ranking error rates than other ranking procedures based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Our experimental results also demonstrate that, with the new procedure, this method can be scaled for hundreds of alternatives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) is used to rank the alternatives according to evaluation information based on multiple attributes, and many MADM methods have been studied to deal with the MADM problems. In existing MADM methods, when setting different attribute weights, the ranking of alternatives are different. And ranking range can be used to measure a lower bound and an upper bound of rankings of alternatives with the change of the attribute weights. Also, in some real MADM problems, the information on attribute weights may be unknown or partially known, which is called incomplete attribute weight information. Then, this study investigates the ranking range models (RRMs) under incomplete attribute weight information in the selected six MADM methods: Weighted geometric averaging (WGA), Ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA), TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE and ELECTRE. Particularly, we can construct several 0-1 mathematical programming models to compute the ranking range of alternatives under incomplete attribute weight information for the selected six MADM methods. Then, two case studies on project investment and Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) are used to justify the validity of the RRMs under incomplete attribute weight information in the selected six MADM methods. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Aerobic fermentation composting can transform solid organic waste into biological organic fertiliser, while reducing resource wastage and ecological damage. However, in the composting process, a serious loss of nitrogen occurs, primarily in the form of the release of ammonia gas. The release of ammonia gas not only pollutes the environment, but also diminishes the presence of nutrient elements, resulting in compost products that are lower in quality. Given that many factors influence the release of ammonia gas during the aerobic fermentation process, it is difficult to determine optimal process parameters. In an effort to address this issue, we propose herein a combinational weighting method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weighting method to determine the weight of each secondary index. We also establish a parametric optimisation model based on the ammonia release conditions of the ELECTRE-I method that provides a theoretical underpinning and a decision basis for optimising the process parameters that mediate the release of ammonia during the aerobic fermentation process. This method can be widely employed to reduce the release of ammonia gas and may be of significance to the future development of bioengineering-based composting technology. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Renewable energy (RE) microgrids are considered one solution for solving the increasing electricity demand and environmental pollution problem. Selecting RE sources for a microgrid plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the microgrid. Illustrated with an empirical study on a city's microgrid project, this article proposes a new evaluation approach with a bi-capacity based multi-criteria decision making method called Bi-ELECTRE to evaluate and select RE source alternatives based on interacting performance indicators with bipolar measurement. With the novelty of the Bi-ELECTRE method, this article addresses the questions of (a) how to measure interactions between bipolar-scaled indicators when evaluating the RE source alternatives of a microgrid, and (b) how to determine the optimal combination of RE sources for a microgrid. The results from the empirical study suggest that a microgrid with a single RE source has the worst performance, compared with multi-source alternatives. In the empirical study conducted, the microgrid using a RE source combination of 20% wind, 30% solar, and 50% biomass has the best overall performance. By considering interactions between bipolar-scaled indicators and various combinations of RE sources, the proposed approach contributes to MCDM research methodologically and to the RE source selection problem for a microgrid practically. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate all or any combination of parameters for the ELECTRE II, III or IV, methods. The algorithm takes some steps of a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the approach as Ranking Trees Algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, for a given method, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and actions (alternatives). Second, for each generated model, all actions are projected in a 1D space; in general, the best actions have higher values in a 1D space than the worst ones; therefore, they can be used to guide the genetic algorithm in the final step, the optimization phase. Finally, in the optimization phase, each model has its parameters optimized. Findings: The results can be used in two different ways; the authors can merge all models, to find the elicitated parameters in this way, or the authors can ensemble the models, and the median of all ranks represents the final rank. The numerical examples achieved a Kendall Tau correlation rank over 0.85, and these results could perform as well as the results obtained by a group of specialists. Originality/value: For the first time, the elicitation of ELECTRE parameters is made by an ensemble technique composed of a set of uncorrelated multicriteria models that can generate robust solutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Extension in bi-polar fuzzy set results in m-Polar fuzzy (mF) set. It is a methodology developed over the years since 2014. Integrated with various multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, several hybrid algorithms developed to improve the accuracy of the mF set algorithm used for decision making. Algorithms like mF TOPSIS and mF ELECTRE-I are widely used algorithms. In this paper, we aim to solve a selection of robots with the mF ELECTRE-I method. It is implemented in a stepwise manner and elaborated as an mF ELECTRE-I algorithm. We have collected Robot selection data from a previously published research article. Results obtained using mF ELECTRE-I are compared and validated with the same research article. We found that the mF ELECTRE-I method is well resulted in getting the rank solution of robot selection. The rank obtained by mF ELECTRE-I is more consistent with the original research done for robot selection. Graphically presented results are with outranking relations. We can solve a wide range of industry problems starting from pole=1 to available subgroups to implement mF set techniques. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={In this research, veto related structures are introduced into multi-attribute utility models for classification and sorting in order to allow for the principles of constructivism, incomparability and non-compensation of unsatisfactory preferences. Several extensions are proposed to incorporate veto into additive and multiplicative models. The first approach builds on the concepts of UTADIS and ELECTRE TRI methods. The ascending procedure is applied to sort alternatives by comparing their global evaluations to utility thresholds that define the bounds of adjacent categories. The assignment and incomparability categories are obtained in this way. The second approach to aggregate utility and veto pertains to the case of hierarchical sorting. Properties of sorting models are also studied. Several characteristics are determined with a simulation study, and a special veto independency condition is considered. Because it deals with the decision-making problematics of sorting, the presented research complements our previous study which has assessed risk aversion of veto for the case of ranking. © 2021 Samo Drobne – Lidija Zadnik Stirn – Mirjana Kljajić Borštnar – Janez Povh – Janez Žerovnik},

abstract={Structural analysis of components is an important task in design phase which ensures the success of the design before stepping for product manufacturing. The material selected for a product to serve a particular function need validation through certain analysis for the application desired. The present work aims to conduct structural analysis of spur gear pair subjected to different torque values such as 132, 190 and 225 Nm. Structural steel, Aluminium Silicon composite, AISI 4140 alloy steel and Ti6242S are the materials considered for static structural analysis to evaluate total deformation, strain energy, equivalent von mises stress and equivalent elastic strain by varying the torque for a spur gear pair. The analysis results are further taken as input for multi criteria decision making to identify the best and worst material options through COPRAS and MOORA. The weights of the individual output responses are evaluated through CRITIC method and utilized for calculating the weighted normalized matrix. COPRAS recommend Ti6242S as the best material and Structural steel as the worst preference. The recommendations of MOORA are in confliction with COPRAS. MOORA recommends Structural steel as the best material and Ti6242S as the worst option. The results are further validated through TOPSIS and it has a good agreement with COPRAS technique than MOORA. The novelty of the present work is that the results obtained from FEA have been taken as an input for multi criteria decision making for selecting the material. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach aimed at sorting those failure modes potentially involving critical components into risk classes for interventions prioritisation and maintenance control. In this context, the sorting technique ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI is applied to support in finding the root causes that can be eliminated for failure prevention and/or minimization. This methodology presents the advantage to not rely on comparisons (as well as on their transitivity) between pairs of elements, simplifying computations for complex systems. To be sorted, decision elements are indeed compared with single reference profiles and the final assignment may constitute a valid alternative to the traditional ranking of failures achievable by other MCDM techniques and, among others, consistency-based methodologies. The proposed approach will be eventually applied to a case study from the industrial reality. © 2021 Proceedings - 26th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design, RQD 2021.

abstract={The manufacturing sector is now facing the challenge of complying with strict environmental regulations due to global warming, lack of natural resources, and waste management issues. Increased environmental problems and awareness lead to the implementation of green production practices by manufacturers worldwide. Green manufacturing (GM) activities form the basis of green and environmentally friendly goods production. There are, however, several possible indicators for GM implementation. There has been some good research on GM indicators, but little research in the Indian automotive industry has to date been undertaken on GM. In this analysis, the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy (F-AHP) method is incorporated into the Elimination Et Choix Traduisant La Realite (ELECTRE-I) procedure to define and rank the six main indicators as well as rank the case company’s three plants for GM implementation. The proposed framework is accredited by a leading factory manufacturer of steering systems in India. This study shows that Efficiency of Environmental Management System and Hazardous Waste Management are the leading indicators for GM, and plant P1 is the best alternative for the six indicators among the three plants. Our research will support the priority setting of key indicators influencing green manufacturing practices in the automotive industry. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Cartographic generalization is a process similar to text summarization that transforms a map when scale is reduced. Cartographic generalization simplifies the map content while preserving as much as possible the initial characteristics and spatial relations of the map. The automation of this process requires a deep understanding of the context of each map feature, which involves different criteria such as the shape of the feature, the semantic nature of the feature, or the spatial patterns of its neighbouring features. This is why multiple criteria decision techniques can be relevant during the process. This paper proposes two use cases of cartographic generalization sub-tasks where multiple criteria decision techniques improve past techniques: the classification of urban building blocks and the ordering of the buildings to keep in the map as a priority. In both use cases, the proposed methods are experimented on large real cartographic datasets, and evaluated in comparison to alternative techniques. © 2021 British Cartographic Society.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper presents an algorithm that can elicitate (infer) all or any combination of elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE) Tri-B parameters. For example, a decision maker can maintain the values for indifference, preference and veto thresholds, and the study’s algorithm can find the criteria weights, reference profiles and the lambda cutting level. The study’s approach is inspired by a machine learning ensemble technique, the random forest, and for that, the authors named the study’s approach as ELECTRE tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate a set of ELECTRE Tri-B models, where each model solves a random sample of criteria and alternates. Each sample is made with replacement, having at least two criteria and between 10% and 25% of alternates. Each model has its parameters optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) that can use an ordered cluster or an assignment example as a reference to the optimization. Finally, after the optimization phase, two procedures can be performed; the first one will merge all models, finding in this way the elicitated parameters and in the second procedure, each alternate is classified (voted) by each separated model, and the majority vote decides the final class. Findings: The authors have noted that concerning the voting procedure, nonlinear decision boundaries are generated and they can be suitable in analyzing problems of the same nature. In contrast, the merged model generates linear decision boundaries. Originality/value: The elicitation of ELECTRE Tri-B parameters is made by an ensemble technique that is composed of a set of multicriteria models that are engaged in generating robust solutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Then the results of those methods were compared against each other in order to find a robust model for selecting strategic plans. The correlation coefficient between methods indicated that multidimensional and ELECTRE methods with 0.944 are the best performing and AHP with negative correlation (-0.455) is the worst performing method for selecting strategic plans in BSC. The high correlation demonstrates that the model can be a useful and effective tool to finding the critical aspects of evaluation criteria as well as the gaps to improve company performance for achieving desired level. Developing multidimensional model is the core model for the selection of strategic plans. This study addresses the problem and issues of group decision making process for selecting strategic plans in BSC. It has numerous contributions that particularly includes; 1) Determination of the explicit criteria sub-criteria and criteria to improve ranking strategic plans in BSC, 2) Adopting MADM analytical methods including AHP, ELECTRE, BORDA, TOPSIS and SAW for the selection of strategic plans decision problem in BSC, 3) Developing multidimensional model to address the selection of strategic plans problems in BSC. The proposed model will provide an approach to facilitate strategic plans decision problem in BSC. © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={At the level of design of thermal power plants (TPP), when making decisions related to the choice of its macro location and micro location, disposition solution and equipment structure, the choice of the right decision method is of particular importance. Multi criteria analysis involves solving inadequately structured problems, while in practical terms it is a necessary tool in solving the day-to-day tasks of decision-making, management actions, both at the design level and the exploitation of complex energy and process systems. The development of new methods and the improvement of existing multi criteria analysis methods have influenced their increasing application in the field of energy, from both theoretical and practical aspects. A particular segment of the application of multi criteria analysis methods is to make strategic or operational decisions when solving multidisciplinary problems with predominantly technical or predominantly economic content, whether looking at a part or the energy system as a whole. The application of these methods in choosing the right solutions in the decision-making tasks of management in the design, maintenance and operation of thermal power plants is based on the development of information technology and computer technology. There are several methods in use today, of which the following should be emphasized: PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod of Enrichment Evaluation), AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), IKOR, ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choice Translating REality), MAX-MIN, MAX-MAX, Hurwicz (combination of max-max and max-min methods), SAW (Simple Additive Weighting Method), TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), conjunctive method, disjunctive method, etc. Depending on the method used, the ranking of alternatives or criteria, the best alternative or criterion or set of alternatives or criteria that meet certain conditions is obtained as a solution. Problems that can be considered using multi-criteria decision-making have certain common characteristics: a large number of criteria that must be created by the decision maker, a high likelihood of conflict between the criteria, inseparable (different) units of measure (as a rule, each criterion has different units of measure), as well as design or the choice of optimal concepts in a predetermined space. Solutions are either designing the best alternative or choosing the best action from a set of predefined final actions. This paper provides a brief description of the more important methods, along with an analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, as well as the possibility of applying them to solve the specific problem of choosing a micro location for TPP. Starting from the application of the modified multi criteria method for determining the priorities between individual alternatives for ranking and selecting the optimal micro location within a certain macro location within a predetermined framework, in a decision situation involving a number of decision makers of different specialty, examples of micro location selection for new thermal power facilities of TPP Stanari are given, TPP Gacko 2 and TPP Ugljevik 3, with preliminary definition of elimination criteria and criteria for comparison of locations of given TPPs. © 2020.

The relation between them is complex and less explored. The mutual relationship between them involves various concepts, so this study makes use of the existing tool called hybrid multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) method to prioritize the factors influencing sustainable product design in the context of green consumer behavior. The hybrid MCDM method AHP–ELECTRE II technique was used in this study to investigate the relationship between the green consumer behavior and sustainable product features. The practical applicability of this method was also proven in this paper using a case study done in an automotive manufacturing organization.

abstract={Selection of an appropriate hospital for availing medical treatment has become a very tedious task for patients these days. As the service quality of a healthcare unit involves measuring multi-faceted attributes, such as tangibles (infrastructure, apparatus, etc) and in-tangibles (waiting period, doctor expertize, trustworthiness, employee behavior, etc). SERVQUAL methodology has been successfully applied for measuring service quality for many years but due to its certain limitations many new approaches appeared for solving the issues related to multiple criteria decision making. In this paper, a novel model has been proposed based on six service quality dimensions i.e. tangibles, responsiveness, reliability, assurance, empathy [Parasuraman A, Zeithaml VA, Berry LL. A conceptual model of service quality and its implications for future research. The Journal of Marketing. 1985;49(4):41–50.] and trustworthiness and twenty-eight sub-dimensions for measuring the performance of four multi-specialty hospitals of Punjab, India. The service quality performance of these hospitals has been measured and ranked using Fuzzy Set Theory, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (F-AHP) and Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE-I) technique. The weights of the six dimensions and sub-dimensions were generated and then the performance of each hospitals was ranked by applying F-AHP & ELECTRE–I technique. The results showed that the patients have given their priority towards trustworthiness and empathy aspects before selecting any hospital. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Recently competitiveness has become one of the most used concepts in the urban and regional planning literature. This research aims to show the competitive situation of the eight metropolises in Iran based on the quality of life indices. The analytical, descriptive method used in this research to show the facts that are involved in different metropolises. Applying framework, required information gathered from world cities information center (NUMBEO https://www.numbeo.com/). ELECTRE III (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité, in French) is an effective Multi Criteria Decision Analysis method. The results indicate that important effective factors in population selection of living in the metropolis are commuting time or traffic, the ratio of income to property price and health. Hence, metropolis ranking demonstrates that in terms of quality of life Shiraz placed on the first level and Ahwaz at the last level. Isfahan, Qom, Tabriz, Mashhad, Tehran, and Karaj respectively ranked from second to seventh. Tehran as the capital city with the highest population concentration does not have enough competitive power against other metropolises and for entering into the international system require deliberate attention to the effective factors of quality of life. In addition, the results show the application of the framework in measuring metropolis competitiveness based on the quality of life is very important and competitive can promote sustainability, adaptability, and quality of planning. © 2020 Kharazmi University of Tehran.

abstract={High stability and low settling rate of phosphate fines in water suspensions encountered the dry area-located mines with serious environmental and technical challenges. The best suggestion for these mines is paste thickener installation for dewatering. In this research, the novel procedure has been proposed for evaluating the potential of paste thickeners in dewatering mining tailings. The case study is Esfordi phosphate complex (Iran). Initially, the selection criteria of a proper flocculant (environmental effects, price, particle settling rate, turbidity of overflow water, and underflow water content) were evaluated for current consuming flocculant (A-27) and 12 other ionic and nonionic flocculants. Then, flocculation performance was ranked based on the type and concentration, applying multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques of ORESTE, MAPPAC, and ELECTRE. Subsequently, the pilot-scale tests were performed for the selected flocculants and the operational conditions were evaluated for the maximum underflow solid content of 70 wt.%. The results of the present research showed that installation and application of this type of thickener could be effective for the case study. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Deficient maintenance management of water distribution systems is an issue in many countries around the world. In northeast Brazil, losses of water during its distribution has reached 42.7 %. Maintenance planning is essential to improve efficiency in a water distribution system. Therefore, a framework was proposed that combines Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA) with the ELECTRE TRI-nC method to sort areas into criticality categories in order to determine priorities for monitoring a maintenance service. To provide a global characterization, three categories are recognized: “Not critical,” “Moderately critical,” and “Highly critical.” The proposed framework is applied in a real case study of a municipality located in the northeast of Brazil (Itamaracá/Pernambuco). This framework provides (i) managerial priorities to support maintenance decisions that improve the action planning of the water company, (ii) formal and structured knowledge about the water distribution system, and (iii) benefits to society, such as improving the quality of service, reducing costs, and preserving water resources. Our study demonstrates that actions such as developing awareness -raising campaigns about the rational use of water, installing pressure and flow control valves and establishing sectorization in the network system are essential in order to improve how maintenance is managed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={According to behavioural finance, economic agents display cognitive bias, heuristics and emotional factors that generate preferences which systematically violate the rationality assumptions of the normative model of classical decision theory. Rather than maximizing the expected utility, representing the optimal choice, they attempt to accept a satisfactory solution. Morton and Fasolo (J Oper Res Soc 60:268–275, 2009) outlined some behavioural findings relevant to the practice of multicriteria approach. In this paper, we propose a multicriteria model for analysing some experiments proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (Econometrica 47:263–29 l, 1979). Our aim is to verify whether a multicriteria tool reduces or minimizes cognitive biases. We focus on ELECTRE due to its main features: it accepts the violation of some mathematical axioms. By a simulation study, we represent a set of prospects by means of decision matrices: the prospects are considered as alternatives, the events as criteria, the probabilities of events as the weights assigned to criteria. Then, we apply ELECTRE to verify whether the preference ranking among the alternatives confirms the results obtained by Kahneman–Tversky, that is, whether it is able to describe the emotional behaviours of economic agents. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This article presents a two-step framework for the selection of the optimal tourist origins portfolio for a particular destination. The article applies this decision-making process to French Polynesia. The first step of the framework is based on a mean–variance optimization procedure and proposes the subset of portfolios among which the decision-maker must limit her/his choice. Second, the multicriteria ELECTRE method is employed to rank all the portfolios considered on the basis of decision-makers’ preferences exposed in the parameters of the algorithm. Three decision-maker profiles are proposed from a risk-averse profile to a risk-lover profile. This article contributes to the dedicated literature by presenting ELECTRE III as an alternative to the utility function approach used by previous studies. Results of our application to French Polynesia’s tourist attendance data (from 2014 to 2017) highlight the usefulness of the framework exhibited and empirically underline the economic perspectives offered by Chinese tourists. The French Polynesian application follows a clear presentation permitting consideration of applications to other destinations. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={There are multiple Multi-Attribute Decision Making methods elaborated for the past years. Those methods are targeted at aggregating assessments provided by the stakeholders of the problematic situation in order to choose the best alternative from the set of given ones. This paper considers ELECTRE, TOPSIS and the Multi-Level Linguistic Decision Making Methodology. In this paper we try to challenge first two methods by comparing it to latter method. One of the biggest challenges of modern Decision Making methods is flexibility to accept not only quantitative assessments but also hybrid ones: qualitative, interval, mixed etc. This brings the necessity for fuzzy computations. Decision Making methods analysis is performed through deep dive in constitution of each method and comparison across the set of elaborated criteria. Key criteria for the Decision Making methods assessment were identified and the comparative analysis on the base of two scenarios of different complexity was elaborated. The conclusion is made that ELECTRE and TOPSIS are well suited for small problems containing only several (less than a dozen) alternatives and criteria while being hardly generalized for the case of poorly structured problems (pollution, hunger, poverty). At the same time, Multi-Level Linguistic Decision Making Methodology excels at analyzing the problem from multiple aspects and considering any number of experts with arbitrary expertise that is beneficial in complex decision making cases. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMSs) rely on a set of technologies to quickly adapt the manufacturing system capacity and/or functionality to meet unexpected disturbances, such as fluctuation/uncertainty of demand and/or unavailability/unreliability of resources. At the operational stage, such disturbances raise new production requirements and risks, which call upon Decision-Makers (DMs) to analyze the opportunity to move from a running configuration to another more competitive one. Such a decision is generally based on an evaluation of a multitude of criteria, and several multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches have been suggested to help DMs with the reconfiguration process. Most existing MCDM approaches require some assignment of weights to the criteria, which is not a trivial task. Unfortunately, existing studies on MCDM for an RMS have not provided guidelines to weigh the evaluation criteria. This article fills in this gap by offering a framework to set up such weights. We provide a comprehensive set of quantitative indicators to evaluate the reconfiguration decisions during the operation of the RMS. We suggest three weighting methods that are convenient to different levels of DM expertise and desired degree of involvement in the reconfiguration process.

abstract={Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) deals with the process of solving decisions problems considering multiple criteria emerging from the preferences of decision-maker. The basic working principle of MCDM process is the selection of criteria, the selection of alternatives, and the selection of weighting methods to represent importance. The main purpose of this paper is to rank several alternatives for tower cranes operation movements. The methodology employed is based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for finding out criteria weights and the ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) outranking procedure to find the best alternative. A case study considering four important criteria that have influence on the operation motion of tower cranes are employed. They are the total project time, the total project cost, the coverage area, and the availability of tower cranes. Six alternatives are evaluated by ELECTRE method. The results of the case study determine the best alternative based on the concordance-discordance ELECTRE method. Also, in this paper, sensitivity analysis has been performed considering the most critical criterion and the most critical measure of performance. The most sensitive criterion is the coverage area of tower cranes and the most sensitive alternative is the third one. © 2020, Cairo University. All rights reserved.},

Autonomic software is quite different in working compared to non-autonomic software. So, quality estimation parameters will also be different. Quality assurance method for autonomic software has not been standardized yet but quality parameters based on autonomic features have been suggested by researchers. Based on the functioning of autonomic software and autonomic capabilities, Autonomicity and Trustworthiness are considered to be the major quality estimation metrics. In this paper, trustworthiness estimation is performed using six attributes. To contribute in this area further, attributes are ranked based on the weights estimated using Electre-Tri multi-criteria outranking method. The attributes weights can be used further to estimate trustworthiness for any autonomic software. With this, the quality estimation task can also be processed for autonomic software. © 2020, © 2020 Taru Publications.},

abstract={Currently, to meet the requirements of modern power systems as fully and efficiently as possible, the electricity markets have diversified greatly. Under these conditions, it becomes difficult for a producer to determine the structure of transactions that is financially optimal. Starting from the operational rules of the power systems that have shaped the electricity markets structure, the objective of this paper is to develop an electricity market simulator model that includes the basics of a best practice guide for producers that compete on various electricity markets to carry out the trading activities and enhance their financial results. The market simulator model considers both the bilateral long- or mid-term agreements and shortterm offers on day-ahead, ancillary services and balancing markets providing the entire trading scenario and associated cash-flow and risks. Its significance consists in assisting the producer to plan its resources and create projections by performing multiple trading scenarios and selecting the best one. Thus, this paper proposes to uncover constraints and business rules for a simulator model assisting the market players to access the electricity markets and select the best option using Multiple-Criterial Decision-Making (MCDM) methods (Electre, Topsis, Analytical Hierarchy Process) or the weighted Euclidean distance. The simulations comprise four trading scenarios for different types of producers (gas or fossil-powered generators) generating 100MW, that are ordered by independent criteria. The results obtained withMCDMand the proposed method showed that they indicated the same scenario as the best trading option based on the type of the producer. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Firstly, we introduce the definitions of PMVNSs and the classical ELECTRE method, discuss the ELECTRE-based outranking relations for PMVNSs and analyze some properties of them. Furthermore, the probability multi-valued neutrosophic ELECTRE method is developed to address MCGDM problems based on the proposed distance measure and outranking relations for PMVNSs. Finally, a typical example for logistics outsourcing provider selection is devoted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Moreover, the same example-based comparisons with other existing methods are carried out, the results show our proposed approach outperforms the existing methods in solving the MCGDM problems with PMVNSs. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={An inevitable aspect of modern petroleum exploration is the simultaneous consideration of large, complex, and disparate spatial data sets. In this context, the present article proposes the optimized fuzzy ELECTRE (OFE) approach based on combining the artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm, fuzzy logic, and an outranking method to assess petroleum potential at the petroleum system level in a spatial framework using experts' knowledge and the information available in the discovered petroleum accumulations simultaneously. It uses the characteristics of the essential elements of a petroleum system as key criteria. To demonstrate the approach, a case study was conducted on the Red River petroleum system of the Williston Basin. Having completed the assorted preprocessing steps, eight spatial data sets associated with the criteria were integrated using the OFE to produce a map that makes it possible to delineate the areas with the highest petroleum potential and the lowest risk for further exploratory investigations. The success and prediction rate curves were used to measure the performance of the model. Both success and prediction accuracies lie in the range of 80-90%, indicating an excellent model performance. Considering the five-class petroleum potential, the proposed approach outperforms the spatial models used in the previous studies. In addition, comparing the results of the FE and OFE indicated that the optimization of the weights by the ABC algorithm has improved accuracy by approximately 15%, namely, a relatively higher success rate and lower risk in petroleum exploration. © 2020 Mohamad Hamzeh and Farid Karimipour, published by De Gruyter 2020.},

abstract={This study proposes a novel ranking method, called SentiRank, that integrates data coming from aspect-level sentiment analysis into a multi-criteria decision aiding procedure. The novelty of the work is the combination of the evaluation of the features of a set of products (based on user preferences) with the reviews in social networks about the same products. The contribution of this work is twofold: theoretical and practical. From the theoretical side, we propose an automatic method to extract the aspect categories and their evaluations from the online opinions of users. Next, we describe how to merge that information with the decision maker’s preferences about the features of a set of products. The ELECTRE method is used afterwards to rank the products with both types of input data. From the practical side, we have implemented a tool that can be used to rank a set ofs restaurants in Tarragona, using available data and reviews on the Web. The tests show that the ranking is effectively modified when online reviews are included in the analysis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Background: Nowadays mining companies, as non-profit organizations like other organizations, face a complex and turbulent environment. The proper guidance of the organizations depends on understanding the internal and external environment and making smart strategic decisions. Therefore, to deal effectively with all the factors that affect the ability of the company in its profitable growth, because organizations need compiling strategic planning to increase their capabilities, long-term growth and survival and to reduce operational risk, organizations have turned to strategic planning in particular. After compiling strategies, determining the priority of strategies is very important. The statistical population of this research has consisted of 50 heads of operational and support affairs units [to determine internal factors] along with 10 managers and deputies [to determine external factors]. In this research, strategies were first identified via the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats [SWOT] matrix and then ranked by the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment [WASPAS] method. Materials and methods: In addition to the QSPM approach, multi-indicator decision-making models can also be used to prioritize strategies. Nowadays, as multi-indicator decision-making related topics are intensified and on the other hand, the increasing tendency towards interdisciplinary sciences and the use of theories of various groups and specialties in solving complex problems, the necessity to pay attention to decision-making analysis techniques and exploiting them in solving existing complex problems is of great importance. In these models, selecting one option among the available options is considered. In a general definition, multi-indicator decision making refers to specific [preferential type] decisions, such as evaluating, prioritizing, or selecting among the available options [which sometimes should be done among several contrasting indicators]. Some multi-indicator decision-making models are: AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, VICTOR, TOPSIS, SAW, GRA, SIR, PROMETHEE and WASPAS. In this article, the WASPAS method has been used to determine the prioritization of strategies. Results: In this research, strategies were first identified via the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats [SWOT] matrix and then ranked by the Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment [WASPAS] method. Ultimately, the strategies of "assigning a part of the sale to individuals or qualified private companies", "creating the Technology Transfer Office [TTO] in order to move towards self-sufficiency", and "comprehensive planning in the field of human resources in order to create an effective and efficient culture" were selected as strategic priorities for the Alpha Mining Company. Conclusions: Various approaches have already been proposed to prioritize strategies; in this research, the criteria have been specified using the ACCEPT approach and finally by the WASPAS method, the strategies have been prioritized. The ACCEPT method unlike the QSPM method, which prioritized strategies by taking into account strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, regardless of environmental conditions and existing organizational status and externally by considering 6 main parameters of strategy evaluation including cost, time, popularity, effective, and so on, helps to prioritize strategies. In this research, it was tried to use one of the techniques of MADM according to relevant and important criteria to enhance the assurance coefficient of managers’ decision making. Multi-criteria decision-making techniques have this advantage that they evaluate various options according to various criteria that do not have equal units. Another important advantage of multi-criteria decision-making techniques is that they are capable of analyzing quantitative and qualitative criteria simultaneously. © Copyright: Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

abstract={This paper primarily focuses on mathematical models for anticipation of actuation force and displacement for IPMC actuator which was utilized to actuate a PDMS-based microgripper. To achieve higher actuation force and displacement, higher voltage (4.5 V) and lower frequency (0.001 Hz) values are to be ensured. Moreover, for higher actuation force KCl dopant and for actuation displacement DW work, doping solutions are to be used. In order to select proper material for compliant gripper, a systematic approach taken by adopting MCDM techniques like TOPSIS, MOORA, COPRAS, ELECTRE-II and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was found to be the best material. ANSYS-14 software was utilized to adjudge the compatibility of actuation force exerted by IPMC and the functionality of PDMS gripper prior to fabrication.

abstract={ELECTRE is a multi-criteria decision aiding methodology widely extended in many fields of application, such as environmental risk assessment, systems evaluation or analysis of financial management actions. The ELECTRE-III-H method generates a partial pre-order on a set of alternatives at different levels of a hierarchy of evaluation criteria. This method models the decision maker's preferences using three parameters on each of the intermediate criteria of the hierarchy. These parameters must take values depending on the positions of the alternatives in the partial pre-orders. For a non expert user, the definition of those values is not trivial. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying method in order to assign the appropriate values. In this work, some assisting tools have been designed and implemented to help the user to find the most suitable values for these parameters. First, some initial sets of parameters are automatically calculated by the system for some predefined common preference models. Second, the user has several tools to explore the space of possible values starting from these initial ones. The system also generates several graphics that display the results obtained using different parameters, so that the user can easily identify which ones represent his preferences. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={Analyses of complex water management decision-making problems, involving tradeoffs amongst multiple criteria, are often undertaken using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. Various forms of uncertainty may arise in the application of MCDA methods, including imprecision, inaccuracy or ill determination of data. The ELECTRE family methods deal with imperfect knowledge of data by incorporating ‘pseudo-criteria’, with discrimination thresholds, to interpret the outranking relation as a fuzzy relation. However, the task of selecting thresholds for each criterion can be difficult and ambiguous for decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a confidence-interval-based approach which aims to reduce the subjective input required by decision-makers. The proposed approach involves defining the uncertainty in the input values using confidence intervals and expressing thresholds as a function of the interval estimates. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by applying it to evaluate the water supply and sewerage services in Spain. Results show that the confidence interval approach may be interesting in some cases (e.g. when dealing with statistical data from surveys or measuring equipment), but should never replace the preferences or judgments of the actors involved in the decision process. © IWA Publishing 2019.},

abstract={In Mobile ad-hoc networks, virtual backbone construction on the basis of dominating set becomes popular approach to enhance broadcasting and routing activities. Almost all broadcasting schemes that are based on connected-dominating-set (CDS) require topology information related to the 1-hop or 2-hop neighborhood of each node, in addition to maintaining this information. To tackle these requirements an enhanced distance-based neighbor protocol (ENP) proposes and develops in this paper to collect and maintain 2-hop neighbor information within each node. To investigate ENP performance, it was implemented as the neighbor protocol for an established connected-dominating-set and both of them were integrated with AODV routing protocol. ENP performance was compared with the original distance based-protocol that used by CDS and with the periodic approach that used by AODV. In addition, ENP was compared with another event-based neighbor protocol. The simulation results were showed that ENP outperforms its competitors in terms of maintenance overhead and number of times the links broke. All simulation were carried out with QualNet v5.02. The proposed protocol makes preemption in utilizing of Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) algorithm to select the most optimum threshold values that compromise between multiple conflicting parameters. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Systems obsolescence may cause huge invisible internal cost through mis-judgment. It leads to many defects related to the manufacturing system and its environment. While its management is complex, composed by multiple factors and stakeholders, the current tools are still minimal and purely quantitative using cost optimization only. Considering different actors seems essential to ensure a reliable mitigation and resolution strategy. This paper aims to develop an MCDM model specific to obsolescence management by expanding decision criteria and using a non-compensatory and dynamically weighted ELECTRE III approach. The goal is to ensure a robust, sustainable and green manufacturing ecosystem. The MCDM tool was applied to the problem and performed in two case studies from the literature, using DIVIZ platform. The model results were compared to those from previous studies. They show that the decision made changes significantly affecting the manufacturing performance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the key role of a portfolio manager is to identify a suitable asset allocation strategy. The portfolio composition task has to take into account the return and the risk of each asset along with several other factors such as investor's aims, market expectations and risk tolerance. Thus the final decision making can be naturally viewed as a multiple criteria problem whose solution can benefit from Multiple Criteria Decision Making strategies. In this paper, we propose a two-step multi-criteria approach to support the selection of equity portfolios. Our strategy exploits a varying-coefficient Capital Asset Pricing Model framework. First, we identify clusters of stocks having similar systematic risk factors, then we rank these assets using an ELECTRE III method. We also present a real data example on stocks of S&P500 to illustrate the proposed methodology. © 2019 Vita e Pensiero. All rights reserved.},

In this context, we modeled the process of emergency care in the operating room with an IDSS (Interactive Support System Decision) embedded in a system multi agent (MAS). Specifically, the agents are assisted by a decision support system for planning elective surgery and the allocation of the necessary human and medical resources. Agents express their preferences using the method ELECTRE III to resolve the differences. The negotiation mechanism is based on the CNP (Contract Net Protocol).

abstract={Making any investment is an important decision that produces effects with material, financial and human implications, most of the time significant ones. The paper aims to argue, by using the methods of the decision theory, the variant chosen for the expansion of a company in order to introduce new benchmarks required by the market in production. After an analysis of the existing situation, it was noted that the company did not have sufficient capacity, regardless of the improvements made, so an expansion was necessary and justified. Depending on the space and financial resources the company has at its disposal, there are several possibilities for expansion and each implies certain elements. There are three physical variants of expansion, namely: the construction of a new bay, the expansion of the company's central building or the expansion of an outbuilding. Considering that for the possible variants the decision consequences are known, in order to solve the case study the methods for optimizing the decisions under certainty conditions will be used, namely: ELECTRE method, one of the most complex and used methods of optimizing multi-criteria decisions; Onicescu method which solves the same type of problems by means of specific algorithms and the method of coefficient K, using relations from the theory of fuzzy sets. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a noncooperative finite multicriteria two-person game G. We study the problem of refinement of Pareto Nash equilibria of G and we propose an approach based on modeling the preferences of the players by two binary relations. This approach follows three main steps: first, we associate to G another game G¯ defined by the two sets of strategies and two binary relations over the set of the strategy profiles, where each binary relation expresses the preferences of the corresponding player. Second, we define a Noncooperative Equilibrium NCE for the game G¯ and we prove that every NCE of G¯ is a Pareto Nash equilibrium of G. Third, we propose a procedure for finding the set of NCE of G¯ independently of how the binary relations are constructed. Moreover, we give three ways to model the preferences of the players by using scalarization and the outranking methods ELECTRE I and PROMETHEE II. All the steps of the proposed approach are completely illustrated through an accompanying example. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Nowadays, lighting industry can contribute to a more sustainable future, by reducing the total consumption of electrical energy used to illuminate indoor and outdoor spaces. Thus, lighting system design is one of the important components when thinking about building sustainability. Taking into account the final purpose of the lighting installation (the type of human activity that will take place in the indoor space for which lighting is to be provided), the most suitable lighting technologies are selected considering their characteristics, dimensions, and technical specification. The paper presents how a lighting technology selection for a production hall using a multi-criteria decision making approach. There are considered the most common luminaires and lamps which can assure the illuminance necessary for the hall, which represent the variants, evaluated against several criteria, considering the decision maker's preferences and constraints. The variants are ranked according to their performance for each criterion. The optimal lighting solution obtained after the simulation experiment suggests that ELECTRE III method is a practical decision-making model that can be considered for this type of decisions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={A habitable housing program that aims to provide some decent homes has been widely implemented by the provincial government in Aceh. Due to the subjectivity of the decision maker's preferences for distributing the decent homes, some people and other social communities have highlighted the realization of the program as it is considered inaccurate. In order to overcome this problem, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model using ELECTRE with fuzzy sets in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) was proposed. This model utilized the TFNs to express the fuzziness information on criteria weight and the collected data, and used the concept of Centre of Gravity (CoG) to perform ranking order for the fuzzy sets. Based on the concordance and discordance indices determined by the ELECTRE through a numerical example, the result in terms of ranking order for alternatives was obtained. © 2018 IEEE.},

In order to select the preferred stocks in a Portfolio, real-word decisions need to make to solve problems involve conflicting systems of criteria, uncertainty and imprecise information, especially those involve a group of decision makers (DMs) where a reduction of different individual preferences on a given set to a single collective preference, we consider a hybrid fuzzy Electre I approach for group decision-making under a fuzzy environment. The Electre method and its derivatives are prominent outranking approaches in Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which is a widely used decision methodology that can improve the quality of group multiple criteria decisions by making the processes more explicit, rational and efficient. In this study, an alternative fuzzy outranking approach based on Electre I is proposed to consider the imprecise, uncertain, and linguistic assessments provided by a group of DMs. In this approach, the Electre I method is extended to take into account the uncertain, imprecise and linguistic assessments, besides, an outranking relation is defined by pairwise comparisons and the use of decision graphs to determine which action is preferable, incomparable or indifferent in the fuzzy environment. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated using a numerical example. © 2018 IEEE.},

The aim of this paper is ranking of reverse supply chain (RSC) entities upon key stakeholders requirements' fulfillment. In the first step of research, key stakeholders are identified through stakeholder management analysis. Their requirements are analyzed and weighted by using fuzzy Delphi method. The decision makers perform their assessment taking in account linguistic expressions, so they do not need to think about precise numbers. In this way, the process of decision making is made easier compared to the conventional approach. The determination of the RSC entities upon key stakeholders requirements' fulfillment is performed by using the fuzzy ELECTRE method. © 2018, Centar for Quality.},

Then we proceeded to classify intersections: the variety and diversity of attributes suggested the employment of a multicriteria ranking evaluative method: more precisely, we adapted the ELECTRE TRI rating method (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993) with the purpose of rating urban opportunities according to their influence on walking. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

Some extended hesitant fuzzy elements (EHFEs) aggregation operators are proposed. In this paper, the dominance relation and opposition relation for EHFEs which based on traditional ELECTRE methods are introduced and the method for comparing EHFEs is proposed. To extend EHFSs to multi-criteria decision making, we proposed an outranking approach which is similar to ELECTRE III, and the data of outranking approach is in the form of EHFEs.

abstract={Artificial Lift system selection is a key factor in enhancing energy efficiency, increasing profit and expanding asset life in any oil-producing well. Theoretically, this selection has to consider an extensive number of variables, making hard to select the optimal Artificial Lift System. However, in practice, a limited number of variables and empirical knowledge are used in this selection process. The latter increases system failure probability due to pump - well incompatibility. The multi-criteria decision-making methods present mathematical modelling for selection processes with finite alternatives and high number of criteria. These methodologies make it feasible to reach a final decision considering all variables involved. In this paper, we present a software application based on a sequential mathematical analysis of hierarchies for variables, a numerical validation of input data and, finally, an implementation of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods (SAW, ELECTRE and VIKOR) to select the most adequate artificial lift system for crude oil production in Colombia. Its novel algorithm is designed to rank seven Artificial Lift Systems, considering diverse variables in order to make the decision. The results are validated with field data in a Case study relating to a Colombian oilfield, with the aim of reducing the Artificial Lift Failure Rate. © 2018 Ciencia, Tecnología y Futuro.},

The method, which is named GRA-TRI, allows defining a category by reference alternative and realize assignment by considering the mathematical and geometrical similarity in GRA. In the paper, firstly, the notations and assumptions of the method have been described. Then, an illustrative example was performed step by step. By comparing GRA-TRI and ELECTRE TRI-Central, it has been showed that GRA-TRI makes consistent and reasonable assignments. Hereby, an alternative method which is simple and comprehensible, and has the advantages of grey system theory, has been presented. © 2018 Research Information Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A growing interest is expressed by organizations for the development of approaches enabling to take advantage of past experiences to improve their decision processes; they may be referred to as Lessons Learned (LL) processes. Within the LL processes implementation framework, the development of semi-automatic approaches able to distinguish criteria having major influence on the evaluation of experiences is crucial for identifying relevant recommendations and performing efficient prescriptive analysis. In this paper, we propose to contribute to LL study by focusing on the definition of an approach enabling, in a specific setting, to identify the criteria most influencing the decision process regarding the overall performance evaluation of a reduced set of experiences. The proposed approach is framed on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, and specifically is based on the Electre tri method. In this paper, an illustration of the proposed approach is provided studying the evaluation of logistical response strategies in humanitarian emergency situations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={The development of e-commerce site operators in Indonesia is now faced with intense competition for defending the market segment, especially regarding how e-commerce sites are attracting consumers through specific marketing strategies. This study implements a decision support system approach to help marketers to determine price discount alternatives using the Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realite (ELECTRE) method. The ELECTRE method is widely recognized for having good performance in analyzing customer behavior criteria; however, there is little information about discount analysis using the ELECTRE method. This study implements a method for consumer behavior simulation that can be affected by the criteria to make a purchase on a simulated e-commerce website. Our model estimates three parts of the matrices' analysis: (a) average value of discounted price (DP); (b) average value of product brand (PB); and (c) average value of purchase decision (PD). We used these as the main alternatives; e.g., price discounts as first alternative (A1), brand discount as second alternative (A2), and purchase discount as third alternative (A3). Based on the results of the dominant aggregation matrix, the study found that the results are dominated by brand discount (A2). In other words, it is recommended for the decision maker to focus their discount on certain brands more precisely as a marketing strategy than price discount or purchase discount. © 2018, AGH University of Science and Technology Press.},

A new method of proposed 'net' procedure is presented to rank these scheme with valued outranking relation. The advantages and disadvantages of the scheme are expressed from the harmony index and the discordance index, which constitute valued outranking relation by ELECTRE III and weights of criteria are determined by AHP.

abstract={This research evaluated team members’ perceptions of alternative decision analysis approaches when they were asked to analyze a simple or complex data set under a time constraint. There has been significant work done to understand what criteria should be included in this class of problems. However, less work has been done examining the selection of a specific decision analysis approach. This is an area of concern since research has shown that selecting a different decision analysis approach can change the results even when the same data is analyzed. This research effort is a preliminary look at perceptions of alternative decision analysis approaches. A mixed method study analyzing quantitative and qualitative data was completed. Teams were assigned to use one of five different decision analysis approaches, including Weighted Sum, SMART, TOPSIS, AHP, and ELECTRE I. After applying the approach to either a simple or complex data set, team members were surveyed to determine perceptions including comfort with the approach, its results, and ease/difficulty of explaining the approach to coworkers. Discussions were also held with team members to gain additional insights. The study indicated that team members preferred less technically challenging decision analysis approaches, such as Weighted Sum and to a lesser degree SMART, when they were using a simple data set because they found the approach easier to use and to explain to others. The more technically challenging decision analysis approaches, such as AHP and ELECTRE I, were preferred with a complex data set because they provided better insight into the problem. Teams in this study did selected different alternatives when they used different decision analysis approaches. Demographic data was also collected but was not found to influence results in this study. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Fuzzy-TOPSIS is one of the most widely applied methods for solving multi-attribute decision making problems. However, an analysis of academic and real-life applications of this method has pointed out that the final alternative scores are very close, with little dispersion among them, making it difficult for the decision makers' to choice/ranking the alternatives. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the ability of Fuzzy-TOPSIS to discriminate alternatives, making it easy for a decision maker to select or ranking alternatives. To achieve this, we redefined the computation of the positive and negative ideal solution of the classical TOPSIS method as a combination of the fuzzy concordance and discordance indexes from Fuzzy-ELECTRE. The proposed model was validated in a real case study, and further compared with Fuzzy-ELECTRE, using simulation experiments, and Fuzzy-TOPSIS, using results from four recent papers published in the literature. The results obtained show that the proposed method improved the ranking and sorting of the alternatives for all analyzed cases, considering ranking dispersion, global interval range of the scores, and the difference between the first and second best alternatives. The main justification for this behavior is the partial non-compensatory nature of our method, introduced by incorporating some ELECTRE's elements into Fuzzy- TOPSIS.

abstract={ABSTRACT: The occurrence of accidents in petrochemical industries that cause environmental catastrophes has persuaded experts to use risk-oriented approaches. The approach is to rank the key elements of risk assessment by which the priority of each risk is specified compared to the other ones. The present study was performed to test the applicability of a multi-criteria decision-making approach for prioritizing environmental risks of a petrochemical complex in southwestern Iran. Accordingly, all risky activities of the Sodium Carbonate Production Unit (SCPU) were identified initially. Afterward, the relevant environmental components affected by the risky activities were specified. According to the specification, the most significant risks were shortlisted using experts’ judgment based on three criteria: “impact intensity,” “occurrence probability,” and the “extent of contamination dispersion in the environment.” The shortlisted environmental risks were then prioritized by the Method “Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality)” abbreviated as ELECTRE. Based on the obtained results, “decreased air quality” and “manpower health threatening” are the top-priority risks while “poor quality of groundwater” was identified as the least priority risk. In a general conclusion, a multi-criteria decision-making approach is quite useful for assessing environmental risks of petrochemical industries. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article proposes a new two-step procedure for investment decision making under uncertainty. We choose a set of particular shares funds for potential investment. An investor sets several criteria evaluating the investment alternatives. The investment decision making process includes some uncertainties, namely vague decision maker (DM) preferences or random elements. The decision making procedure is divided into two steps. Firstly, the extensive sets of shares funds are cut down in order to choose a few funds for the final investment portfolio. To select the funds, the fuzzy ELECTRE I approach is applied. This approach is able to accept vague information about criteria values or weights of criteria via fuzzy numbers. To make the final portfolio, an interactive multiple objective programming method is proposed. This method takes into account fuzzy DM preferences and allows for collaboration in the process of portfolio making. In the end both methods are applied to create the investment portfolio of shares funds under uncertainty and the results are discussed. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, a multi-criteria approach for ranking the Municipalities of the States of Mexico by their levels of marginalization is proposed, and the case for the State of Jalisco is presented. The approach uses the ELECTRE III method to construct a medium-sized valued outranking relation and then employs a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to exploit the relation to obtain a recommendation. The results of this application can be useful for policy- makers, planners, academics, investors, and business leaders. This study also contributes to an important, yet relatively new, body of application-based literature that investigates multi-criteria approaches to decision making that use fuzzy theory and evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods. A comparison of the ranking obtained with the proposed methodology and the stratifications created by the National Population Council of Mexico shows that the methodology presented consistent and reliable results for this problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Industrial decision-making generally involves more than one decision-maker, with regard to the different implied decision criteria on the one hand, and the numerous deployed decision levels on the other hand. Structures of control based on the notion of decision centre (DC) are organised for dealing with these industrial decision-making aspects. Coherence problems, between the different interacting DCs, in their decision-making processes, are thus raised. This article investigates the answers allowed by the MCDM (multicriteria decision-making) field for handling such coherence problems. This aspect is situated within the problem of the group decision, where two or more decision-makers are involved in the decision process. Three types of collaboration between the DCs are highlighted, namely the communication link, the coordination and the cooperation links. A DC preference model, based on the outranking ELECTRE method, is proposed first. This model is then adapted to take into account the previous types of collaboration.

abstract={An anaerobic digestion pilot system was implemented in June 2010 in the Moroccan village of Dayet Ifrah. The input material consists of toilet wastewater and cattle manure. Biogas is produced under anaerobic conditions. It is used for heating and cooking. This biogas system could be an useful sanitation technology due to its ability to treat wastewater. The biogas system was monitored over 86 days in summer 2012 to measure gas production. The average gas production recorded was about 1,870 l per day. This amount is sufficient for a farming family composed of 17 people. Our work seeks to find the most appropriate formula to predict biogas production under Moroccan conditions. We compared and ranked different formulas by applying principal component analysis and the ELECTRE III method. The variables studied were the chemical oxygen demand reduction and biogas volume measurements. The results show that the formula of Vedrenne is the most appropriate equation to predict biogas production in Moroccan rural areas (see Vedrenne (2007) 'Study of Anaerobic Degradation Processes and Methane Production During Storage of Manure'.

abstract={Methods based on fuzzy outranking relations constitute one of the main approaches to multiple criteria decision problems. In this paper we examine multicriteria selection and ranking problems for which ELECTRE 3 is one of the most popular methods. ELECTRE 3 applications require the elicitation of a large number of parameters: weights and different thresholds; but direct eliciting is often an arduous task for the decision-maker. In this paper, an evolutionary multi objective-based indirect elicitation of the complete ELECTRE 3 modelparameter set is proposed. The proposal needs some kind of "preference knowledge", which is implicit in a set of reference examples illustrating the decision policy from a "decision-maker". This method performs very well in some illustrative examples; its generalization to other outranking methods is straightforward. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={P2P systems are distributed, decentralized networks that enhance resource sharing. The decentralized, open and anonymous nature of P2P systems can raise serious concerns for a peer. There is no control or accountability on the content or resources that a peer can share on the network. Hence, the process of selecting the right peer for collaboration and its decision making process becomes difficult. This paper discusses the implementation of three methods of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) models Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) and ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE). A detailed comparative study of the three models was performed and the results are presented. From the results it can be inferred that while the execution time for AHP method is higher than that of the other two methods, it has the optimal selection of the given alternatives according to the requirement. PROMETHEE AND ELECTRE support the selection of best choice among the alternatives. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Coalition stability is a major concept in coalition formation. One important problem in many stability concepts in n-person game theories is one assumption that the preference of each agent is publicly known. The coalition is said to be stable if there is no objections by any subset of agents according to the publicly known preference. Such assumption is contrastive with the situation of several software agent applications. Individual agents in the applications have private preferences and make a decision according to his/her preferences instead of common knowledge. This study proposes a novel preference coalition formation algorithm for a buyer coalition that attempts for unambiguous considering private preference of individual buyer within the buyer coalition process. The theoretical foundations of the study are rooted in the fields of multi criteria decision making, human practical reasoning, and n-person game theories. The existing literature on multi-criteria decision making, human practical reasoning, and n-person game theories were reviewed in order to determine an appropriate algorithm for the proposed buyer coalition framework with emphasis on private preference of individual buyer. For validation of the proposed algorithm, simulation software was developed to demonstrate results of a variety of simulations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The implementation of Sustainable Development (SD) within an Organization is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to deal with conflicting and incommensurable aspects such as environmental, economic and social dimensions. In this paper we have used a Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) methodology to cope with these difficulties. MCDA methodology offers the opportunity to avoid valuation of the different dimensions of the SD. These dimensions are not substitutable for one another and all have a role to play. There is an abundance of possible aggregation procedures in MCDA methodology. In this paper we have proposed a method to choose a suitable aggregation procedure for SD problems. The outranking approach (i.e., ELECTRE) and the mono-criterion synthesis approach (i.e., MAUT approaches based on the Choquet integral) were implemented to rank 22 SD actions within an expertise Institute and rank 20 actions to control energy consumption of the Institute's buildings respectively. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this work an initial methodological approach for the military staff assignment problem is presented. The approach is the utilization of multicriteria analysis to assign staff into a number of categories according to predefined criteria. The Electre Tri method has been used for the proposed model which is capable of handling decision problems with multiple criteria.

This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on linear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply LDA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approach outperforms both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Electre Tri methods. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Researches on evaluation of Quality of Life (QOL) gained much attention in quantitative studies and on urban areas especially since recent years. In this study two quantitative methods, namely AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and ELECTRE II (Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite - Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) are used to evaluate QOL. QOL was determined, compared and ranked for eight counties in metropolitan Ankara Metropolitan for the purpose of providing a database for local governments, decision makers and planners involved in policy making, as well as to construct a base for comparative analysis for different urban areas. Different weights were assigned to indicators in two experiments for the eight counties of Ankara during the QOL evaluation process. Result values showed great disparities between the counties in terms of QOL. This information is important especially in revealing problems and for the allocation of scarce resources. Determination of trends over time and awareness of changing conditions and priorities should also be considered as factors for further studies. The study also shows that both AHP and ELECTRE II method can be applied in QOL assessment and ranking. © 2010 Academic Journals.},

These refer to specific alternatives (samples) of the training dataset that are good representatives of the groups they fit in. In this paper, experiments are conducted over two prototype selection (PS) techniques employed to improve the accuracy of two prototype-based MCDA classification methods. The PS techiques investigated are based, respectively, on a customized genetic algorithm and on the Electre IV approach, whereas the MCDA classification methods studied comprise the one proposed by Goletsis et al. and the well-known PROAFTN method. The results achieved demonstrate that the classification methods are indeed very sensitive to the choice of prototypes and that the PS techniques investigated may be instrumental for leveraging their performance levels. ©2009 IEEE.},

Technique for order preference by similarity degree to ideal solution method is one of the methods for ranking the alternatives . The similarity degree is based on the distances of the alternative versus the two ideal solutions: positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution. This paper introduces a new distance between alternatives based on the preference structure induced by the ELECTRE method. With the new kind of distance, we can derive the two distances between the alternative and the two ideal alternatives respectively and the similarity degree between the alternative and the positive ideal solutions. And then the alternatives are ranked according to the similarity degree. Finally, a numerical example will be treated to illustrate the method. © 2009 IEEE.},

The first approach involves a genetic algorithm in order to generate acceptable solutions, from which the best ones are chosen by using a Pareto Sort algorithm. The second approach combines the previous Genetic Algorithm with a multicriteria analysis methodology, i.e., the Electre method in order to find the best solutions.

abstract={Performance measurement is a method to quantify project success based on project and policy outputs and outcomes assessment. In the United States, transportation-related performance measures have become popular since authorization of the lntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act in 1991. Performance measures have been applied in many areas, including freeway operations. This paper improves on earlier techniques and presents an innovative approach for using a multicriteria decision framework to select freeway operational performance measures. The proposed selection performance measure methodology includes establishing a statement of purpose, identifying alternatives, establishing criteria, and using a screening approach to eliminate unsatisfactory performance measures by means of qualitative and quantitative criteria. Once the screening approach is used to reduce the set of candidate alternatives to a set of feasible alternatives, the methodology uses a multicriteria decision model, such as simple additive weighting and ELECTRE III, to combine the commensurate criteria and generate a rank order of the acceptable alternatives for final decision making. A sample application of the proposed methodology is presented.},

Robustness analysis on MADM is a hotspot in these years which wins academe's great attention, and is supposed to be an effective way when countering imperfect information. Setting parameters in ELECTRE-III is a vital and difficult step. In this paper, a method of inferring ELECTRE-III's parameters with fuzzy information based on robustness analysis is presented. First, ELECTRE-III is transformed into a continuous smooth function of each parameter vector. Then, robustness analysis structure and a parameters inferring algorithm are provided by maximizing robustness margin based on mathematics programming. Moreover, how to resolve the programming problem is also discussed. At last, a illustrative example of Naval Gun Weapon System Integration is put forward.},

abstract={Houses have a long life and are slowly replaced. That is why high quality residential developments are wanted and needed not only because of the increase in quality of life offered by these developments, but also because of the more efficient use of resources available and the increasing need to protect the environment. High quality housing needs to meet a series of criteria and attributes. To an extent, classifying different attributes of housing quality is an oversimplification, because technical, economic, environmental and social aspects intrinsic to any definition of sustainable housing and which cannot be the object of a trade-off have also to be taken into account. This paper examines the use of multi-criteria analysis to select houses from a range of options in the order of their overall quality. Multi-criteria analysis is one of the means by which the architect can reconcile the precise needs of the client/developer with the technological, economic and architectural aspects of the project. This methodology can also assist the house buyer to make the right decision in choosing a house, new or old, that suits his/her needs. It can also be used as a methodology for assessing the 'best' house project in a design competition. The problems and complexity of the decision making process in all these cases are exacerbated by the many criteria a high performance building has to meet. ELECTRE III - a multi-criteria decision making tool - is described and discussed here as a specific method to select high performance/quality houses from a range of presented options.

abstract={Matching forage supply to demand is a key issue in efficient pastoral production and one of the few tools that sheep and beef farmers have to manipulate supply is the mix of forages on their farm. With an extensive range of species and cultivars available, the problem of choosing which forage to sow can be daunting. This paper describes the planning, implementation, and release of ForageMaster®, a decision support and learning tool developed under a Meat & Wool New Zealand (M&WNZ) programme to provide advice on forage selection. Forage selection is a multi-criteria decision, using information relating to potential performance, ability to withstand any pests and diseases, and the function that the farmer wants the forage to perform. The ELECTRE III outranking method was selected as the core of the decision model. The inputs required by the decision model were lists of the criteria important to the user and the relative weights of these criteria. Using the ELECTRE III method, it was also possible to show users which of their criteria influenced the recommended forages and to see why some forages were excluded from consideration. This allowed users the opportunity to reflect on the criterion weightings that they selected and to see why the software selected particular forages. Forage selection decisions are made infrequently, so it was essential that the user interface for ForageMaster® be intuitive, that it requested information in a form that was readily available to users, and that it was robust. Considerable effort went into the design of the interface, and the design was tested with mentor groups to ensure that farmers found the information to be readily available to them and easy to understand. An example input screen is given in Figure 1. Software tools released without support are unlikely to be used to any significant degree. Over fifty workshops were therefore held throughout the country to discuss the many aspects of forage selection, establishment, and management, and help farmers learn to use the software in their decision processes. The workshops were designed using the principles of the AgCelerate® learning programme. (Figure Presented) While it is too early yet to state that ForageMaster® has been totally successful in its ultimate aim, to improve on-farm productivity, the degree of farmer interest in attending workshops using ForageMaster® suggests that the software will be well-used. The key steps in producing the ForageMaster® software were that: • it was ensured that the objective of the software aligned well with what farmer mentor groups wanted; • the software had a very intuitive interface; • the recommendations made by the software were presented in a manner that allowed the user to easily discover the rationale for the recommendations, and so build trust in the software; • the release of the software was accompanied by a large number of workshops, which the farmers had to attend if they wanted to get a copy of the software. Progress with ForageMaster® will be monitored, but at this stage it seems this has been a successful formula and one that is likely to be followed in development of future tools.},

In this paper, ELECTRE is introduced and used to obtain the optimal condition for a complicated manufacturing process, namely, silicon wafer manufacturing. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the method and can certainly be used to solve many other manufacturing processes with multiple responses.},

abstract={The ELECTRE II and III methods enjoy a wide acceptance in solving multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Our research has revealed that there are some compelling reasons to doubt the correctness of the proposed rankings when the ELECTRE II and III methods are used. In a typical test we first used these methods to determine the best alternative for a given MCDM problem. Next we randomly replaced a non-optimal alternative by a worse one and repeated the calculations without changing any of the other data. Our computational tests revealed that sometimes the ELECTRE II and III methods might change the indication of the best alternative. Although such rank irregularity is well known for the AHP approach, it is the very first time that they are reported to occur when the ELECTRE approach is used. These methods are also evaluated in terms of other ranking tests and they failed them as well.},

abstract={The geographical information systems (GIS) provide the decision-maker with a powerful set of tools for the manipulation and analysis of spatial information. The functionality of GIS is, however, limited to certain deterministic analyses in key application areas such as spatial search. Land suitability evaluation has to face two major difficulties. First, there is a huge number of alternatives because each different coordinate is a possible solution (raster representation). Second, the decision making process is generally based on different criteria, which can be defined on a quantitative or a qualitative scale. Multicriteria evaluation (MCE) is one of the solutions for such complex choices situations as they appear in land suitability evaluation and territory management. The integration of multicriteria methods with GIS is forwarded as providing the user with the means to evaluate various alternatives on the basis of multiple and conflicting criteria and objectives. This paper explore the possibility of improving communication between land use and decision makers, using an interactive system combining GIS and multicriteria methods. An example application based on the search for the best 1000 hectares of industrial land in Nakuru (Kenya) using IDRISI (raster GIS) and ELECTRE (MCE methods) is included. The finality of our study is to compare results obtained from the classic approach (without multicriteria analysis) and those obtained from the approach combining SIG and MCE. © 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

We show that reactive applications may be dealt with from two points of view. First, from the chronological point of view, i.e., when reactions are instantaneous, generated by event occurrences in discrete time. Second, from the chronometrical point of view, when reactions have durations in dense time. This duality must be expressible in languages that allow a consistent programming of both synchronous and asynchronous features. The objective of mixing these dual approaches leads to model reactive systems by using hybrid systems, to deal simultaneously with both discrete and continuous phenomena. Furthermore, this must be followed by some verification of the application's properties, with respect to its behavioural and quantitative features. We analyze several existing frameworks that meet these requirements, and propose our own approach based on the language ELECTRE.},

abstract={One of the crucial stages in the operation of quarry exploitation is the selection of an appropriate mining method because the lack of attention to this issue may bring about many problems in the process of mining, leading to extra charges incurred to the mine owner or the possible drop in the quality or quantity of the mine product. The adoption of the appropriate method of quarry mining, given the various interacting factors involved, requires a multi-criteria decision-making method. This paper makes use of the hybrid AHP-ELECTRE model to examine the conventional quarry mining methods including Diamond Wire Sawing, Blasting, Feathers, and Wedge as well as the expansive agents such as KATROCK and FRACT.AG in the granite quarry of Gazik located in the South Khorassan Province, taking into consideration various factors such as the gross profit increase, safety, quality, decrease of adverse environmental effects, wastage, and the reduction of mining time. In this model, the weights of the items were applied by the AHP method, and the items were assessed through non-rank comparisons so that, finally, the Diamond Sawing Blasting was chosen as the most appropriate method of Gazik granite quarry mining based on the ELECTRE model. Such studies can aid in managing the mining costs to decrease, which can lead to the profitability of the quarries. © 2022 University of Tehran, Faculty of Engineering. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Considering the environment of risks and influences inherent in the decision-making process for credit-granting operations, it has become a matter of survival for financial organizations to seek to improve how they engage in effective decision-making to ensure that their returns on invested capital will meet the expectations established at the beginning of the process. A credit-granting sorting model for financial organizations is proposed. The model aggregates the perspectives of different decision-makers to support an organization in the process of credit analysis and, consequently, to improve its operationality. The decision-making model is based on the ELECTRE TRI-B multicriteria method. It sorts credit-granting proposals into three classes, namely credit approved, technical analysis, and credit rejected. The group decision emerges from the decision rules of the organization’s executive board. This new proposed approach to dealing with credit-granting results in the systematization of credit analysis, reduction of doubt among decision-makers, avoidance of the emergence of informal groups, reduction of conflicts within a financial organization, and external interferences. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The presence of pharmaceuticals and metabolites in effluents has become a serious environmental problem, so it is essential to be able to monitor these microcontaminants using qualitative approaches, as well as to assess the potential environmental risks that such compounds may present. Therefore, in this study, suspect screening analysis was performed of 2030 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in hospital effluent samples, applying different sample preparation techniques. Additionally, a pioneering association of (Q)SAR assessment of identified contaminants with the ELECTRE multi-criteria decision analysis technique made it possible to prioritize analytes according to their environmental risk, in order to enable their inclusion in environmental monitoring programs. The results showed that the most advantageous alternative sample preparation technique consisted of cleanup (100 mg of silica/alumina sorbent) + dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (7.5 of aqueous matrix, 325 μL of chloroform (extracting solvent), and 500 μL of acetonitrile as dispersing solvent). This procedure resulted in the identification of 70 pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the composite sample tested. The suspect screening analysis found a total of 105 microcontaminants, 28 of them being “confirmed compounds” and 77 being “suspect compounds”. Of the compounds identified, 87% were pharmaceuticals and 13% were metabolites. The compounds identified were subsequently evaluated using different open access software packages, considering eight endpoints: mobility, persistence, estrogen receptor binding, wastewater treatment plant total removal, biodegradability, PBT (persistent, bioaccumulation and toxic), mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity. The (Q)SAR prediction results were used as input data for the ELECTRE outranking method. Categorization of the identified compounds by ELECTRE resulted in the kernel (priority compounds) and a further 19 groups. ELECTRE sensitivity evaluation indicated that for all the cases, the kernel and the following two groups coincided. The categorization provided by the ELECTRE method constitutes a highly intuitive decision and choice tool, which can assist in the selection of compounds if subsequent quantitative analysis is to be carried out. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is undoubtedly that the environmental and economic benefits will increase by integrating electric vehicles, which are the vehicles of the future, with the car-sharing system. The problem of determining the locations of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and service areas of the car-sharing system appear with the integration. Environmental and energy concerns are the biggest driving factor behind electric car-sharing systems. In this study, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is proposed for the solution of site selection problems of electric car-sharing stations (ECSS). To do so, a three-step solution methodology is developed: (i) determining 20 sub-criteria and weighting the criteria with fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (f-AHP), (ii) obtaining a suitability map for potential ECSS via GIS, (iii) sorting the performance levels of ECSSs assigned according to the suitability map by Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE). The proposed methodology is applied for Istanbul, a metropolitan city in Turkey as a case study. The results show that the most suitable areas for ECSSs in the European and Anatolian side, Istanbul is an intercontinental city, are the south-east part and south-western part, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the context of a rapid and massive deployment or renewable energy and in particular solar photovoltaic, it is necessary to develop methods and tools to guide this deployment. To this end, this work proposes a multicriteria approach for evaluating the suitability of a building to be equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems (PV suitability). In the present case, technical (roof complexity), economic (payback period), environmental (CO2 reduction), energetic (self-consumption), as well as social (heritage constraint) criteria are considered. These criteria are evaluated for each building of the Greater Geneva Agglomeration (GGA), a cross-border French–Swiss territory of nearly 270 000 buildings. A multicriteria method, ELECTRE TRI, makes it possible to sort these buildings into three categories, A, B, and C, that correspond to “very high,” “high,” and “moderate” PV suitabilities, respectively. Large differences are observed within the 210 municipalities of the GGA since some of them have almost no A-ranked buildings whereas others comprise more than 70% of these buildings. It is shown that, by prioritizing the A-ranked buildings, almost 50% of the annual electricity consumption of the Geneva Canton could be produced by PV systems. Finally, the method developed here offers a decision-aiding tool that could be used at a territory scale to achieve energy transition goals in terms of solar PV deployment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Road traffic crashes have been a leading cause of death in Southeast Asian countries, which greatly harms the development of countries and affects the livelihood of countless families in this region. In this context, a regular review of road safety attainment is needed to understand why road crashes happen and to better guide the ongoing policymaking and implementation of effective countermeasures as well as next-level strategies. This study introduces an easy-to-use, effective, and systematic methodology for multi-criteria decision-making, CRiteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) - ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) - Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) (CRITIC-ELECTRE-FCM). Its purpose is to appraise the road safety attainment of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. Accompanied by the robustness of analyses with other widely used methods, these countries are ranked and grouped into several levels regarding their road safety attainment over the past decade (2009–2018). The findings provide government officials, policymakers, and any stakeholders of these countries with meaningful information (e.g., what has been done well and what has not) and instructive guidance for future action. Overall, the proposed appraisal system serves as an efficacious policymaking support for countries in the region to review road safety attainment, develop future strategies and policies, and implement safety management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The soil is not always suitable or competent to support a direct shallow foundation in construction. In many cases, to avoid costly deep foundations, it is indicated to replace, improve, or reinforce such soil. This paper focuses on evaluating the contribution to sustainability between different soil improvement techniques and the outcome of their application to the foundation of a single-family house as an alternative to the one built. The life-cycle performance in sustainability is compared between the baseline design (without intervention), backfilling and soil compaction, soil-cement columns, rigid inclusion of micropiles, and nailing of precast joists. To characterize sustainability, a set of 37 indicators is proposed that integrate the economic or environmental aspects of each design alternative and its social impacts. A sustainability ranking is obtained for the different alternatives based on the ELECTRE IS method for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). The sensitivity of the obtained results is evaluated against different MCDM methods (TOPSIS, COPRAS) and different criteria weights. The evaluation provides a cross-cutting view, comparing the ability and reliability of each technique to prioritize the ground consolidation solution that best contributes to the sustainability in the design of a building's substructure. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={This study exploits the tremendous theory of ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) method to enhance the number of outranking approaches for the ground-breaking and recent extension of fuzzy set theory, namely, complex spherical fuzzy set. The noticeable edge of this striking model is its wider and flexible structure that empowers it to encompass the abstinence part of vague information in addition to satisfaction and dissatisfaction in two dimensional scenarios. In short, this article delivers the compact procedure of the widely applicable, high skilled and multi-purpose complex spherical fuzzy ELECTRE II approach. The designed algorithm of the presented methodology cumulates the worthy opinions of the decision-making experts in the light of complex spherical fuzzy weighted averaging operator. Furthermore, proposed method is privileged with the remarkable notions of concordance and discordance sets in order to unfold the pairwise relation between the alternatives regarding any criterion. The proposed approach predicts the final ranking of alternatives with the aid of crisp strong and weak outranking relations to filter the strict and weak precedence between any pair of alternatives. The practical application of the proposed approach is demonstrated via a case study to opt the most efficient technology to treat cadmium-contaminated water. A comparative study with complex spherical fuzzy ELECTRE I (CSF-ELECTRE I) and spherical fuzzy TOPSIS (SF-TOPSIS) methods is conducted to collect the enough evidence to foreground the authenticity and aptitude of proposed technique. © 2022},

abstract={The fuzzy set theory introduced by Zadeh, 1965 is considered as one of the powerful tools in handling the uncertainty and vague concepts in a more practical way with great progress in every scientific research area. Fuzzy sets (FSs) have number of applications in different research fields such as engineering, computer sciences, arts, humanities, life sciences, mathematics, and health sciences and moreover, it has been extended to number of new types. Among all the extensions, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) introduced by Atanassov, 1986 broadens the field of fuzzy sets in a reliable way by adding the third component called as Hesitancy index (π) along with the membership (μ) and non-membership (v) functions. For the decision-making problems, MCDM (Multi-criteria decision making) is considered as one of the appropriate weapons in finding the best alternative among the different criterion. The aim of present review paper is to provide a detailed analysis on the multi-criteria decision making techniques under the fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy set from the year 2011 to 2015. We also described how fast the role of fuzzy theory increases in solving the MCDM (multicriteria decision making) issues. In addition to this, we also systematically conduct a review on the different applications and methodologies of MCDM techniques such as AHP, PROMETHEE, ELECTRE, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and ANP etc. © 2022 Author(s).},

abstract={ELECTRE is a family of multi-criteria decision analysis techniques, which has the ability to provide as much as possible precise and suitable set of actions or alternatives to the underlying problem by eliminating the alternatives, which are outranked by others. Group decision-making is an effective process to provide the most appropriate solution to real-world decision-making scenarios by considering and merging the expert opinions of multiple individuals on the problem. The aim of this study is to present an extended version of the ELECTRE I model called the Fermatean fuzzy ELECTRE I method for of multi-criteria group decision-making with Fermatean fuzzy human assessments. The method proposed in this study has the possibility to solve multi-criteria group decision-making problems by using the Fermatean fuzzy decision matrix obtained in Fermatean fuzzy number form in the evaluations made with the available alternatives based on expert opinions. First, the mathematical description of the multi-criteria group decision-making problem with Fermatean fuzzy information has been given. Then, the proposed Fermatean fuzzy ELECTRE I method to deal with the problem has been presented. After the determination of the relative importance degree of experts, the Fermatean fuzzy aggregated averaging operator is employed to merge the individual Fermatean fuzzy decision matrices produced by the experts into the aggregated Fermatean fuzzy decision matrix. Next, for pairwise comparison of available alternatives with respect to considered criteria, the concepts of Fermatean fuzzy strong, midrange, and weak concordance and discordance sets are based on the approach of score function and accuracy function defined for Fermatean fuzzy numbers. Afterward, Fermatean fuzzy concordance and discordance matrices are defined, constructed by concordance and discordance indices. Finally, Fermatean fuzzy effective concordance and discordance matrices are computed to obtain Fermatean fuzzy aggregated outranking matrix, indicating abstract information on dominations of suitable alternatives to the others. The proposed method will be used in material selection in distinct implementations, exclusively in biomedical applications where the prosthesis materials should have similar characteristics to human tissues. Since biomedical materials are used in various parts of the human body for many different purposes, in this study, material selection will be made using the method presented for the femoral component of the hip joint prosthesis for orthopedists and practitioners who will choose biomaterials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is a proactive reliability and risk management technique extensively used in practice to ensure high system performance by prioritising failure modes. Owing to the limitations of traditional FMECA, multi-criteria decision-making methods have been employed over the past two decades to enhance its effectiveness. To consider the vagueness and uncertainty of the FMECA evaluation process, an interval-based extension of the Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) TRI method is proposed in the present paper for the classification of failure modes into risk categories. Therefore, ratings of failure modes against risk parameters are provided in an interval form by a panel of FMECA experts and then properly synthesised to provide a group consensus and improve the accuracy of the results. The relative importance of the risk parameters is also considered. The method is validated using a numerical example relating to the propulsion system of a fishing vessel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes a master-slave approach to quantify, combine and balance energy-risk and cost-risk involved in a generation portfolio with renewable and fuel-based technologies. Subjective preferences of the investor on risk, cost and emission are traded-off using pareto-optimization and quantified using multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Temporal variations in renewable energy production led to ‘energy-risk’ (kWh), characterized by energy-return-risk Efficient Frontier (EF). The uncertainty in the energy production cost of the fuel-based sources (FBS) results in ‘cost-risk’ ($/kWh), represented by cost-risk EF. These efficient frontiers are combined using the concepts of Sharpe ratio and tangency portfolio. The master portfolio (MP) gives a percentage share for the total renewable and total conventional generation. The slave portfolio (SP) assigns internal weights within the renewable (solar and wind) and within the fuel-based (coal, natural gas, and oil) generations. The best solution is selected from the pareto-front by calibrating the investor preferences using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and then verified using Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE). It is understood that a completely customizable multi-criteria portfolio selection can be achieved by incorporating subjective views of the investors, eliminating one-sided energy portfolios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, risk factors should be identified and rehabilitation priority should be established by considering all factors. Determining rehabilitation priority areas is very important in terms of public health, service quality and operating cost. The aim of this study, which was carried out in Malatya, Turkey, was to determine rehabilitation priority in wastewater systems by integrating the ENTROPY, ELECTRE and TOPSIS methods. Some 26 physical, hydraulic, operating and cost factors were considered. The factor weightings were determined by the ENTROPY method to define the factors’ contributions, based on the field data. Rehabilitation priorities were then determined separately using ELECTRE and TOPSIS, taking the factor weights and field data into consideration. Priority regions in rehabilitation were obtained similar according to both methods. The results obtained will provide a reference for wastewater system management and determination of rehabilitation priorities. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={The sustainability of energy systems is increasingly assessed for development of more resilient, greener district heating (DH) systems. That requires compiling technological, environmental, and economic indicators in a social, political, and institutional context. This work investigates DH system sustainability analysis by five frequently applied multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods—WSM, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, ELECTRE and DEA. To compare the sustainability assessment results, a selection of 8 criteria describing 12 DH companies (DHC) was examined. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most credible MCDA method. Criteria weights were changed: (1) individually for evaluation of the range of stability for alternatives (score of DHC performance); (2) individually by a fixed value to compare how each criterion weight change affected the average score of a result; and (3) to compare the AHP weighting method to an equal weight scenario. The results of sensitivity analysis along with literature investigation shows that all methods are suitable for sustainability analyses of DH systems while also having differences in the calculation process and in the interpretation of results. The generalized algorithm for sustainability analysis in the energy sector outlined in this study along with the documented features of the main MCDA methods can be used as a guide for future assessment of energy systems by researchers and industry professionals. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={This paper presents research conducted in the direction of analyzing the efficiency of filters used for drinking water intended for domestic consumption, with effects on the water quality gained from the public distribution network. A basic method that uses accessible techniques, such as optical microscopy and tests that involve the use of existing products on the consumer market, was developed regarding the filtration capacities of the main filters existing on the market—a method that has advantages, such as speed and ease of application, a unitary character in obtaining samples, low costs, and high efficiency. The technique approached is that of microscopy, and the samples used were taken from the laboratory tests made on the mentioned filters, using a specific experimental stand designed to support laboratory tests by using chosen filter cartridges. The research results obtained were analyzed to make a classification from the perspective of filtration efficiency, in terms of using statistical analysis tools (mathematical models and methods processed in MATLAB software). Moreover, by using a certain type of application based on specific mathematical algorithms, which takes into account some influential factors with a decisive role on household consumers, it was aimed to identify the optimal filter element for acquisition and use in its own regime. The aim of the study was to identify the optimal filter cartridge from the perspective of quality–price ratio. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Most water distribution networks were built a few decades ago, showing symptoms of deterioration. Additionally, current renewal rates are insufficient to overcome pipe networks’ continuous ageing process. The development of methodologies for assisting the definition of pipe rehabilitation, including which pipes, and when and what financial amounts to allocate to this activity, are of the utmost importance. These methodologies typically have to attend to several points of view, for which multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques may be used. The current paper demonstrates and discusses the application of two MCDA techniques—the ELECTRE TRI-C and FlowSort—to a real water distribution network. Both techniques allowed assigning every single pipe to a predefined priority category, although the ELECTRE TRI-C proved to be more effective. These approaches imply that the planning of investment needs is carried out based on individual pipes, but these approaches are not consistent with the actual rehabilitation projects. A clustering technique called affinity propagation, together with cost functions, were applied to define and quantify homogeneous rehabilitation units. Even so, the methodology did not prove to be rigorous enough for the selection of pipes to be rehabilitated. On the other hand, it proved effective to estimate annual budgets for rehabilitation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Almost all the decision problems are by nature multi-criteria, where multiple and conflicting criteria must be considered in the decision-making process. For some cases of these decision problems, they are further marked by a lackof certainty and precision in the decision-maker’s judgments and preferences. This study aims to propose an extension ofthe ELECTRE III method, widely used in the multi-criteria decision aid field, to the case of a decision problem where thedecision-maker preferences are imprecise and uncertain. In this proposed adaptation, the inaccuracies and uncertainties willbe expressed by an uncertainty interval. The proposed extension will be tested with an example problem to demonstrate itsfeasibility and relevance. In this example of environmental management, we propose to rank three oil refinery installationprojects from the best project to the worst project. The experiment results show that the ELECTRE III method extension canbe used easily and rigorously when the uncertainty intervals express the decision-maker’s preferences. Finally, the resultsobtained in this work can be extended to other multi-criteria analysis methods. © 2022 International Academic Press.},

In order to accommodate QoS requires to be more configured for smooth synchronization, eNB range, and trigger points. This article aims to automate handover by means of sophisticated program based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with ELECTRE and deep reinforcement (DR) learning methods. Network performance is scrutinized and simulation is utilized to visualize the proposed scheme. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed system helps to reduce the handover failure rate and handover ping-pong. Thus, the proposed AHP-ELECTRE-DR-learning method has achieved better results in delay, throughput, fairness index, and packet loss than the existing works like AHP-TOPSIS-Q-learning for handover optimization in LTE-A, auto tuning optimization for reducing frequent handovers and handover failure in LTE-A, and particle swarm optimization with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for LTE and LTE-A networks, respectively. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={As the quantity of garbage created every day rises, solid wastemanagement has become the world's most important issue. As a result, improper solid waste disposal and major sanitary issues develop, which are only detected after they have become dangerous. Due to the system's lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, this scenario became much more uncertain. We are at the stage to develop and execute effective waste management procedures, as well as long-term policies and forward-thinking programmes that can work even in the most adverse of scenarios. We incorporate major solid waste (organic and inorganic solid wastes) approaches that actually perform well in normal cases by reducing waste and environmental disasters; however, in such an uncertain scenario like the COVID-19 pandemic, the project automatically allows for a larger number of criteria, all of which are dealt with using fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making (MCGDM) methods. The ELECTRE III (ELimination Et Choice Translating REality-III) approach, which is a novel decision-making strategy for determining the best way to dispose and reduce garbage by combining traditional ELECTRE III with an interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS), is described in detail in this article. To confirm the efficacy of the recommended model, a numerical explanation is provided, as well as sensitivity and comparative analyses. Obviously, the findings encourage decision-makers in authorities to deliberate about the proposals before creating solid wastemanagement policies. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The use of hydrogen has been shown to be an efficient form of producing energy and meeting society's demands for energy. In this perspective, pipelines are known as the safest and most economical transportation mode for hydrogen. However, accidents in this type of structure lead to multiple consequences of losses such as those related to people, the environment and properties. From this perspective, decision-makers are required to tackle the likelihood of these and to make suitable decisions that can prevent accidents from happening. Multicriteria methods have played an important role in addressing multiple risk problems when there is a need to assign priorities to risk-based decisions. This paper puts forward a multidimensional risk model to categorize hydrogen pipeline sections according to levels of risks based on Utility Theory and the ELECTRE TRI method. A probabilistic modeling is proposed so as to incorporate elements of risk analysis into the evaluation of situations such as accidental scenarios, their probabilities and consequences. An application of the model is presented for a hydrogen pipeline. The results demonstrate that measures to prevent and mitigate risks can be sharpened by taking into account the human, environmental and financial risks dimensions of impacts. Thus, the sections of the pipeline studied are sorted into categories of risks, where 4 out of 10 sections are assigned to the high-risk category, 1 to the medium-risk category, and 5 sections to the low-risk category. A local sensitivity analysis was conducted which varied the weights of the dimensions. Varying the weights by 20% showed that the risk of 3 sections increases to the medium-risk category and 1 section changes to the high-risk one. Moreover, this paper indicates visualization tools that are efficient at communicating information on the levels of risk and the categories of the sections, thus contributing to assessing models that categorize risk in hydrogen pipelines. By doing so this paper supports the process of prioritizing resources for pipeline sections, the aim being to minimize multiple losses. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract={For the formal expression of uncertain data, hesitant fuzzy set theory has established itself as a distinguished model because it has a broad use in multi-attribute decision-making problems. With the incorporation of features from N-soft sets, a useful framework referred to as hesitant fuzzy N-soft sets has acquired an even greater appeal. This model integrates and associates the hesitant environment with information regarding the existence of grades or star ratings. In this research article, we introduce a multi-attribute decision-making technique known as hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-I, which computes the decision-maker assessments in an adjustable and formative manner. The proposed method also improves the robustness and accuracy of the decisions relying on grades or star ratings. Thus it lays a bedrock for subsequent analysis and applications. We justify the relevance and convenience of the proposed technique by testing it in actually existing scenarios. Finally, we give a comparison of this novel methodology with the HFNS-TOPSIS method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

We define certain fleet composition scenarios for a three echelon supply chain and analyse how they match the incoming demand, what kind of customer service can be offered through their application and what level of logistics costs they generate. The decision problem concerning fleet composition is formulated as a multiple criteria ranking problem. Ten fleet composition scenarios - variants are evaluated by a consistent family of seven criteria. We solve the FCP along the concept of Lean/Agile Management. In the computational phase we apply the ELECTRE III/IV method. We model the decision maker's (DM's) preferences and aggregate the variants' evaluations with the application of an outranking relation. As a result we produce a final ranking of solutions - fleet composition scenarios. This allows us to recommend the most desired solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

We propose an innovatory decision-making technique, namely, CS FNS f -ELECTRE I method where the data and information are in modern modes. The proposed CS FNS f -ELECTRE I method enjoys all the distinct and modern attributes of uncertain information which mainly comprises of parameterizations, neutral perspective, multi-valuation and two-dimensional representations. We support the proposed work by a flowchart along with an algorithm and then utilize it to solve the MAGDM problem under CS FNS f environment. This novel technique employs the principles of CS FNS f concordance and CS FNS f discordance sets which are established on score and accuracy functions and engrossed to enjoin the most superior alternative. Ultimately, the decision graph and aggregated outranking Boolean matrix are formulated by merging the outcomes of CS FNS f concordance and CS FNS f discordance indices which are evaluated through score function and distance measures, respectively. Moreover, linear-ranking order is evaluated which provides linear ordering of decision alternatives. A prime MAGDM problem of poverty alleviation is addressed from socio-economic field that approve the flexibility of the intended approach. We perform a sustaining comparison with another approach (CSF-ELECTRE I approach) to assure the productivity and potency of the proposed methodology.

abstract={Bipolar disorder () is a neurodegenerative disease that consists of two main manifestations: mania and depression. In the clinical diagnosis of , there are two primary components. First and foremost is itself which is often wrongly diagnosed as unipolar depression in clinical finding. This is so because in clinical diagnosis the first factor is often neglected due to its approach towards positivity. As a result, the element of bipolarity dies down, and the condition worsens. The second disadvantage is that is frequently misdiagnosed due to comparable indications and symptoms. To overcome these diagnosis issues, a cubic bipolar fuzzy set (CBFS) which comprises both bipolar fuzzy set (BFS) and interval-valued bipolar fuzzy set (IVBFS) is very helpful for clinical diagnosis of . A CBFS has the ability to handle bipolarity with suitable closed intervals to express positive and negative grades to build a solid numerical demonstrating interaction to analyze this disorder effectively. For these objectives, the algorithms of technique for the order of preference by similarity to positive ideal solution (TOPSIS) and elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE-I) for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based on CBF information are developed. The application of proposed algorithms is presented for clinical diagnosis of .

abstract={Recently, the enormous advantages of cloud services make them increasingly appealing to the small and medium-sized enterprises. The growing number of available services makes it challenging to select trustworthy services. Existing approaches focus on user preferences to guide personalized services recommendation for individual users, but lack of the research on trustworthy service recommendation for the small and medium-sized enterprises that represents a group user consisting of multiple individual users. For this type of enterprise, the cloud services recommendation must address the challenges from the diverse client context of individual users, the imprecise quality of experience in an uncertain cloud environment and the invalid or unsatisfactory recommendations. A client context-Aware approach is proposed to recommend trustworthy cloud services for the small and medium-sized enterprises based on non-compensatory multi-criteria decision-making. In it, a type of client context is viewed as an independent evaluation criterion, and the interval neutrosophic numbers are employed to measure the fuzzy trustworthiness of cloud services. Based on the investigated outranking relations of interval neutrosophic numbers, a non-compensatory multi-criteria decision-making procedure via an improved ELECTRE III method is developed to rank candidate services. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach could efficiently produces the accurate ranking results of cloud services and effectively recommend the trustworthy service for small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2022-IOS Press.

abstract={While clustering is a powerful methodology used for grouping objects into families, it is hard to conceive a natural object grouping method without considering the context of a particular application. In high-dimensional problems with large volumes and rapidly evolving part flows, many clustering methods have traditionally been used to form part families considering similarities. In this paper, a two-phase clustering method is developed to optimize the grouping process under technological constraints, in a bid to improve resource planning. The first phase consists in forming part families using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering approach, considering multidimensional parametrization of the part, while in the second phase, the optimal number of clusters is determined using ELECTRE III, which serves to handle uncertainty. Based on a real case study in the electronics industry, an improved production planning solution is proposed to validate the method’s efficiency. The solution was compared to the in-use method to highlight its added value. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to help public transport managers to make decisions on the type of buses that should compose their public transport fleet, taking into account economic, environmental and social criteria from the point of view of sustainability. This paper fills a knowledge gap by including the social dimension of sustainability in addition to the economic and environmental dimensions. The original nature of this study lies in analyzing complementarities in the structuring of an efficiency and multicriteria problem. Our research analyzes Madrid public bus system data; the problem is structured in a comparative way between two analytical methods, a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and an ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) III. Our research results show that two main groups of vehicles could play a part in part the theoretical solution. The main conclusions of this research are that (a) plug-in and induction electric vehicles are not comparable to GNC and diesel–hybrid vehicles in terms of cost, pollution and service; and (b) the ELECTRE III model provides more information in solving this problem than the DEA model. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Decision-making problems often require characterization of alternatives through multiple criteria. In contexts where some of these criteria interact, the decision maker (DM) must consider the interaction effects during the aggregation of criteria scores. The well-known ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) methods were recently improved to deal with interacting criteria fulfilling several relevant properties, addressing the main types of interaction, and retaining most of the fundamental characteristics of the classical methods. An important criticism to such a family of methods is that defining its parameter values is often difficult and can involve significant challenges and high cognitive effort for the DM; this is exacerbated in the improved version whose parameters are even less intuitive. Here, we describe an evolutionary-based method in which parameter values are inferred by exploiting easy-to-make decisions made or accepted by the DM, thereby reducing his/her cognitive effort. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve a regression-inspired nonlinear optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper addressing the indirect elicitation of the ELECTRE model's parameters with interacting criteria. The proposal is assessed through both in-sample and out-of-sample experiments. Statistical tests indicate robustness of the proposal in terms of the number of criteria and their possible interactions. Results show almost perfect effectiveness to reproduce the DM's preferences in all situations. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Flooding is a big issue of widespread concern. Flood control project selection is needed to overcome the flooding phenomenon while achieving other objectives such as decreases the global burden of morbidity, mortality, social and economic disruptions, and stress on health services. Hence, the preferences of Decision Makers (DMs) from diverse backgrounds are needed to obtain the best project. However, flood control project selection faced high levels of conflict. Therefore, we propose a new equitable linguistic scale that provides an inclusive evaluation from integrating DMs’ preferences and opinions. Besides, we also propose a hybrid averaging approach of linear orders; consists of type-reduction method, ambiguity method and (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) ELECTRE-based non-outranked method by the new linguistic scales for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (IT2FTOPSIS) method. An actual case experiment to evaluate seven different flood control projects is carried out in Malaysia based on the evaluation from the Department of Drainage of Irrigation agencies. The result shows that Dikes (levees/embankment)/Channel improvement/Diversion schemes are the best flood control project. Besides, this proposed IT2FTOPSIS can offer a measure of the DMs’ opinions and preferences. Correlation values have also proved that this proposed IT2FTOPSIS in line with the DMs’ decision compared to existing IT2FTOPSIS. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={By outbreaking COVID-19, the sanitarium site selection for coronavirus patients turned into a hot topic. In this article, it is tried to help managers to come up with the hardness of such a complex problem. The quarantine procedure of COVID-19 patients is an essential factor which is suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) for preventing the outbreak. The numerous significant criteria together with many alternatives that could be selected in the real-world cases increase the uncertainty of the problem. So, a hybrid multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) process based on outranking methods is applied to make use of the advantages of those methods. In the decision process, the ELECTRE and VIKOR methods are integrated in the q-rung orhtopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) environment is introduced. As a preliminary part the properties of the q-ROFSs are discussed in detail, and then the ELECTRE and VIKOR methods are investigated. Then the integrated ELECTRE-VIKOR method in a MCGDM algorithm is proposed. To show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method, a case study of sanitarium site selection in Iran is conducted, and results are evaluated in detail. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Accordingly, MCDM has been widely used by DMs from various fields as an effective and reliable tool for solving various problems, such as in site and supplier selection, ranking and assessment. This work presents an in-depth survey of past and recent MCDM techniques cited in the literature. These techniques are mainly categorised into pairwise comparison, outranking and distance-based approaches. Some well-known MCDM methods include the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytical Network Process (ANP), Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE), Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROME-THEE), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Each of these methods is unique and has been used in a vast field of interest to support DMs in solving complex problems.

abstract={ELECTRE I method was coupled with GIS to develop a model for determining the appropriate location of artificial aquifer recharge (AAR) through the floodwater spreading method (FSM). Khoy Plain, Iran, was selected as the case study. A total of 16 technical criteria (categorized as physical, climatic, hydrological, and hydrogeological criteria) was used to zonate the area into five sectors. Subsequently, six scenarios were proposed for the most appropriate locations. It was found that the marginal areas near the mountains, hillside plains, and plain entries, low-grade zones, areas encompassing high-quality underground water resources and with adequate unsaturated zone thickness, and quaternary alluvial sediment zones with high transmissibility, characterize the most appropriate zones for the AAR through the FSM. Combining the results obtained in the first step into a decision matrix, the scenarios were prioritized using a proposed model based on ELECTRE I; accordingly, Scenario 3 was introduced as the optimal approach. In selecting the optimal scenario, not only the weights of the criteria and the concordance and discordance of different scenarios toward one another, but also the numerical values of the concordance and discordance thresholds played essential roles. Further investigation of the scenarios following optimistic and pessimistic approaches showed that the order of preferences of different scenarios were the same following both normal and optimistic approaches. In contrast, the pessimistic approach led to a completely different set of orders of preference, except for Scenario 3, which was again identified as the most appropriate choice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

However, the use of such methods is very limited and rarely considered in manufacturing companies. The aim of this paper is to understand how useful MCDA methods are and how they can actually contribute to the performance improvement of manufacturing processes. More in detail, we aim to understand the practical impact of MCDA methods and their shortcomings when applied to classify manufacturing anomalies in automotive companies. In this sense, we compare the use of two sorting MCDA methods, the AHPSort and the ELECTRE TRI method with the procedure adopted by an automotive manufacturing company to sort manufacturing anomalies in one of the biggest plants in the South of Italy. We show that, despite the methods requiring an interactive process and the involvement of the decision maker, the procedure was well accepted by the management of the plant and helped them to reflect on how the classification of the anomalies was conducted. © 2021.

This extension of soft set approach allows a more intuitive and clearer representation of various decision-making problems involving incomplete or uncertain information. In other words, it is a viable approach to analyze soft-set-based multi-criteria-group decision-making problems in the absence of adequate information resulting from the inability to determine the data. In this regard, this study introduced the concept of three-valued soft set and some of its operations and products. In addition, the formulas required to calculate all possible choice values were proposed for each object in the (weighted) three-valued soft sets and their respective decision values were calculated. Both Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) methods were modified to deal with multi-criteria group decision problems and then, three-valued soft-set-based decision-making algorithms were constructed. To demonstrate the practicality of these algorithms, the examples adopted from the decision problems in real life were addressed. Lastly, some aspects of the efficiency of the proposed algorithms were discussed using computational experiments. © 2021 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={3D printing technologies define the essence of Additive Manufacturing and make possible the agile production of customized parts from different materials, with lower unit cost and waste generation. Currently, one of the most widespread 3D printer technologies is the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) type, which is the object of this paper. The choice of 3D printing equipment depends on the alignment of the purpose of use and technical knowledge to consider certain requirements. Therefore, this choice can be time-consuming and/or imprecise. In this sense, this work aimed to classify FDM-type 3D printer models by applying the ELECTRE-MOr method, a Multi-criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) method. As a result, based on a categorization between classes, the FABER 10 alternative was the only one that presented class A performance in all evaluated scenarios, based on criteria defined by the experts consulted in this study. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Government planning has a relevant role in the human development of cities, and the local public sector acts on legal regulations and budget planning to reach high levels of sustainability and human development. However, there is a gap in local governments related to the integration of decision-making preferences considering sustainability and human development in their budget planning. This work explores how the preferences of decision-makers have been considered in published research found in high-impact journals, and how they have been used in practice or not, especially in the public budget planning for the improvement of the governance of municipalities and human quality of life. The methodology integrated a literature review (by Methodi Ordinatio) with a sorting procedure (by the ELECTRE-TRI method) to categorize the selected papers, considering the level of adherence to the theme and the most relevant contributions, and also a systematic procedure organized by lenses analysis, and Simos’ procedure to define the weights for these lenses. The results that were found can help scholars to access discussions about budget planning distribution, mainly considering the aspects related to sustainable and social goals. The research also helps local public managers to make evidence-based decisions developing the city and local governance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The solutions to deal with the water crisis are summarized into two strategies for managing water resources and extraction of new sources of water. In Iran, due to geographical and climatic conditions, water resources management has a high priority. One of the methods to control and store water in wet periods for using in dry periods is construction of underground dams. The most important problem in the development and creation of underground dams is the complexity of determining suitable areas for the dams. The study area has been confronted with critical water condition due to improper temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall, uncontrolled abstraction of groundwater, drop in groundwater level and interference of saline and fresh water. Therefore, the construction of underground dams can be a practical solution to prevent groundwater levels from falling, land use change, and gradual groundwater salinity. The present study was conducted to find the underground dams using Boolean logic and for priority of underground dam sites using MCDM methods including AHP, ANP, VIKOR, TOPSIS and ELECTRE III in four counties of Bushehr, Tangestan, Dashti, and Jam in southern Iran. The results obtained by Boolean logic showed that the 305 km2 of the studied site has potential for underground dam construction. In the next step, according to Google Earth images and based on different indices including axial length, reservoir, lithology and distance from village and roads, 23 potential axes were identified afterward, by extensive field surveys. Among these 23 potential axes, 6 locations were identified as suitable. To prioritize these six areas, the MCDM models were used. Finally, the results of the MCDM models showed that the sites have different ranks of 1–6 for constructing underground dams. Based on the rank from the Copeland method, Zayer Abbasi and Faghih Hasenan sites achieved the first and the last (sixth) priority, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Heterogeneous wireless networks are an integration of dissimilar networks for better coverage and spectral efficiency. These networks differ in cost, reliability, bandwidth, coverage, security, and other related parameters. And cell users roam across these networks and gets connected to the new candidate network during handoff to maintain call continuity for uninterrupted service delivery. But the decision of selecting an optimal network in such a diverse environment is a challenge. To cater this, Handoff Optimization Algorithm (HOA) having two phases is proposed-Handoff Initialization phase and Network Selection or Decision making phase. This paper discusses the network selection phase of Handoff Optimization Algorithm (HOA) for Future Networks (FN). Six key parameters based on network, mobile and user interest are selected after careful analysis and understanding. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) is used to assign weights to these key parameters and then Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) is applied to rank different networks. Results show that decision making phase of HOA selects the optima network from among the candidate networks based on network, mobile or user inputs. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

abstract={Evaluating sustainable conceptual designs is a crucial part of the development of new products in various sectors because it contributes to the survival and prosperity of companies. Such designs must be compatible with a product's functional requirements and be sustainable in economic, environmental, and social terms. Various criteria, some qualitative and others quantitative, are considered when evaluating sustainable conceptual designs; some criteria may also have sub-criteria, and these criteria and sub-criteria may differ in importance. How to effectively evaluate various criteria and sub-criteria and weight them are the major research problem. This study developed an analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based ELECTRE I method to resolve the evaluation problem; the method entails a two-level hierarchical structure to depict the relationships between the major criteria and sub-criteria and their corresponding weights, with weights obtained through an AHP. Furthermore, an extension based on the addition of net concordance value and net adjusted discordance value is proposed for ranking alternative designs; this extension yields more distinguishable results than the method of [Nijkamp and Van Delft Multi-Criteria Analysis and Regional Decision-Making, Vol. 8 (Springer Science Business Media, 1977)], and the proposed extension in the ELECTRE I method captures more information in the modified summation matrix when aggregating values in the concordance matrix and the modified discordance matrix, representing an advantage over the method of [Zhang et al. Virtual network embedding using node multiple metrics based on simplified ELECTRE method, IEEE Access 6 (2018) 37314-37327]. In addition, to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, the example of the evaluation and selection of sustainable conceptual designs in the furniture manufacturing industry is presented. Finally, a numerical comparison is made to show the advantages of the proposed method. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={During the Talent Development Intervention programme, there is a need to provide an effective model to assess awareness, skills and experience among potential academics. To qualify as an Academic Leader or Academic Manager, there are certain characteristics and t raits necessary. However, there is a lack of research on the training of talented academicians to improve and avoid the loss of these characteristics and traits. Lack of this training would also contribute to vacancy positions of Academic Administrator without being hired. This paper aims to formulate and compare the Multi-criteria Decision-Making methods using ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) and CFPR (Consistent Fuzzy Preference Relations) based on proposed model of Multi Criteria Tacit Knowledge Acquisition (MC-TKAF). One set of empirical study based on proposed model contain seventeen (17) main criteria's and one hundred eights (108) sub criteria are used to select the best candidate to fill in academic administrator roles. In this study, our focus is to integrate MCDM using CFFR and ELECTRE into implementation of Talent Development Intervention based on MC-TKAF development criteria. This paper also highlighted previous literatures which has shown how MC TKAF is formed and the justification of MCDM technique that will be used. The finding shows that both techniques produce the same results. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Moreover, the sensory analyses were performed using elimination et choixtraduisant la realite—elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE), one of the multi-criteria decision-making approach methods. The cooking loss values were found to be low in the final products containing a high amount of dietary fibers. The hardest product among the cooked noodles was the noodle produced using pea fiber that was also the one with the lowest water absorption value. Because of the different characteristics of dietary fibers, the noodles also have different properties. Based on the criteria selected as a result of the ELECTRE analysis performed for sensorial analysis, the most preferred product following the control sample was found to be the IFN sample.

abstract={A new hesitant fuzzy set (HFS)-ELECTRE for multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems is developed in this paper. In real-world applications, the decision makers (DMs)’ opinions are often hesitant for decision problems; thus, considering the exact data is difficult. To address the issue, the DMs’ judgments can be expressed as linguistic variables that are converted into the HFSs, considered as inputs in the ELECTRE method. Meanwhile, an appropriate tool among the fuzzy sets theory and their extensions is the HFSs since the DMs can assign their judgments for an alternative under the evaluation criteria by some membership degrees under a set to decrease the errors. Introduced hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE (HF-ELECTRE) method is elaborated based on the risk preference of each DM with assigning some degrees. Moreover, the weight of each DM is computed and implemented in the proposed procedure to reduce judgments’ errors. Then, a new discordance HF index is provided. Pair-wise comparisons are used for outranking relations regarding HF information. Finally, the validation and verification of the proposed HF-ELECTRE method are demonstrated in a practical example of FMSs. © 2021 Qazvin Islamic Azad University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Selection of a cropping pattern that is suitable for available water resources in each region is one of the important strategies for tackling drought and increasing water productivity. So far, many studies have been conducted to optimize cropping patterns, but their prime focus has been on optimizing the cultivation area of each crop. However, considering stakeholders’ interests and criteria in the region causes an increase in the acceptability and implementation of the modeling results. Crop selection that conforms to regional stakeholders’ criteria for cropping pattern optimization is a parameter that has been less considered in the past. The present study proposes a methodology based on four multi-criteria decision-making models including AHP, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE and ELECTRE combined with Borda count, MVR, Condorcet social methods as well as fallback bargaining method in order to select proper crops for cropping pattern optimization. The suggested methodology was used in irrigation and drainage network of Doroudzan Dam in Fars province, Iran, under normal, wet and arid climatic conditions. The results showed, based on the three decision-making methods, wheat has been introduced as the first priority of the farmers in the study area in most of the regions and under different climatic conditions. Applying the fallback bargaining method to reach an agreement and considering the depth of the calculated agreement for each management region under each of the climatic conditions, the results obtained by the fallback bargaining method often maximize the negotiators’ satisfaction. © 2020, Shiraz University.},

abstract={Energy generated from renewable resources is of supreme importance for the significant and sustained growth of India today. The majority of the power in India is generated from the conventional energy sources, such as, coal, petroleum, and natural gas in thermal power plants, which influence the corruption of our environment a lot. Due to diminishing fossil fuels funds, the future demand of energy will be fulfilled by the renewable energy in India. In this paper, a scientific tool named ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) will be applied for a case study of Nabajiban Missionaries of Charity Brothers-Howrah, to rank the different energy savings substitutes implemented there for ‘greening building’ in a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) environment and the rankings of the substitutes generated by ELECTRE will be compared with the rankings already obtained for that particular case study using another scientific tool named Analytical Hierarchy Process. Consequently, we will finally come into a conclusion, how the unbiasedness of the tools in solving MCDM problems for ‘greening building’ projects helps the decision makers of respective institutions, to invest their funding, in the right projects, viewing the rankings generated by the tools. © 2021, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

abstract={Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) has found many applications in both technical and research sectors. MCA is a way to break the problem into more practicable elements, to permit data and decisions to be judgements to support the elements, and make the right decision. The aim of this paper is to analyze, compare, and make decisions of various current, and future scenarios of different quantifiable indicators for different considerations and various socio-economic aspects. Furthermore, this analysis is used to improve or at least to preserve the environment and natural resources in the basin. In this study an application by a real data set is made, these data are evaluated and extracted from classified satellite images of Loukkos basin, the classification of this satellite images regroups several classes of the data set such as agglomeration, dams, watercourses, croplands, bare soils and forests ... etc. In reality, these data come from different sources like watershed information system (drinking water supply, irrigation system), transportation infrastructures (roads, dams), natural resources (Water, soils, and vegetation), human activities (agriculture, urbanization, and industry) and different socio-economic factors (demography). The main objective of this work is sorting the environmental indicators using the ELECTRE TRI tool, where ten alternatives are considered. We focus the classification of the real data set into the altitude, and the combined surface area factors. The obtained results prove that the classification is stable and the multi-criteria approach ELECTRE-TRI is suitable to a better sorting of the environmental indicators for the Loukkos Basin located in Morocco. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={. Today healthcare globally is growing at a rapid pace and despite the huge technological advancement, healthcare still faces primitive challenges and hence results in the poor service and facility to the needy. Layout planning acts as one major reason which requires improvements for the effective and efficient working of the healthcare facilities. This research aims at optimizing several quantitative criteria related to economic, technology and society which are taken into consideration for the decision-making during the evaluation, analysing and selection of the best layout for an existing healthcare facility. Critical areas for the improvement were found out using statistical analysis based on a survey questionnaire and Apple’s layout procedure is utilised to design the different possible layouts for an efficient facility. The seven criteria namely inter-departmental satisfactory level, the average distance travelled and the average time required for staff flow, the average distance travelled and the average time required for patient flow, the average distance travelled and the average time required for material flow were taken into consideration. The ELECTRE methodology was used as multi-criteria decision making based on decided seven criteria for comparing the different layout by methodical and orderly thinking. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has brought to light a series of concerns for the Brazilian population and government departments due to the different costly consequences that it has generated. It has also mobilized different strategic fronts that plan and implement several mitigating measures against the virus. Besides, the search for solutions for adequate care for individuals in need of support has been constant. This work uses ELECTRE-MOr, a Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) method, to support the logistic plan for the vaccine distribution throughout Brazil, essentially to remote areas. The method allows an objective and structured classification of ideal types of thermal boxes for the storage of immunobiological inside the Cold Chain, presenting the best alternative that maintains the quality of materials until the final destination and has the best cost-benefit. Currently, the ELECTRE-MOr model is under development in a computational tool in Python, allowing the use of the method intuitively and clearly, enabling professionals of any area of expertise to apply it. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The Brazilian Navy (BN) has its combatant force concentrated in an area with only one exit to the sea. Brazil has an extensive coast that needs to be patrolled and, in case of any kind of conflict, the BN must be able to defend the sovereignty and interests of the country. For this purpose, it is necessary a robust and decentralized naval force, which allows the fulfillment of its mission. This paper aims to classify the most suitable cities in Brazil to be established as naval bases, through the application of the ELECTRE-MOr hybrid method. Seventeen cities were analyzed, which have an opening to the sea and have a preexisting minimum port structure. The alternatives were evaluated by specialists from the BN, with more than twenty years of active service, in the light of operational, economic and strategic criteria. As a result, five alternatives were classified as the most indicated to be headquarters for the decentralization of the naval power: Belém/PA, São Luis/MA, Fortaleza/CE, Recife/PE and Aratu/BA. This article presents relevance to academia and society, as it represents the application of a method in the state of the art to support the decision-making process in a significant problem for the sovereignty of Brazil, presenting a methodology that can be applied in problems of tactical, operational, strategic and political levels. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={In this paper, we address the issue of resource allocation in a Cloud Computing environment. Since the need for cloud resources has led to the rapid growth of data centers and the waste of idle resources, high-power consumption has emerged. Therefore, we develop an approach that reduces energy consumption. Decision-making for adequate tasks and virtual machines (VMs) with their consolidation minimizes this latter. The aim of the proposed approach is energy efficiency. It consists of two processes; the first one allows the mapping of user tasks to VMs. Whereas, the second process consists of mapping virtual machines to the best location (physical machines). This paper focuses on this latter to develop a model by using a deep neural network and the ELECTRE methods supported by the K-nearest neighbor classifier. The experiments show that our model can produce promising results compared to other works of literature. This model also presents good scalability to improve the learning, allowing, thus, to achieve our objectives. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The choice of suitable evaluation methods for the layered evaluation of Interactive Adaptive Systems (IAS) needs the consideration of different factors, leading to a multi-criteria decision analysis problem. This paper proposes the first step toward a Web-based Multi-Criteria Decision Support System (MCDSS). Our proposal is based on a recent multi-criteria decision method called ELECTRE TRI-B-H (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) to guide the layered evaluation of IAS. The goal is to support the choice of appropriate evaluation methods for individual layers taking into account constraints of the layered evaluation and the individual layers. The appropriateness of each evaluation method is analyzed for the layered evaluation in general and each layer in particular. The use of ELECTRE TRI-B-H method allows decomposing a decision problem into intermediate sub-problems through a hierarchy model and sorting alternative evaluation methods at different levels of the hierarchy. A case study of an adaptive hypermedia system is presented; in this study, the ELECTRE TRI-B-H method has been applied to select the most suitable evaluation methods for each of its layers taking into account the layered evaluation context. The promising results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, leading to various research perspectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Human–robot collaboration (HRC) is a gradually consolidating paradigm of the modern industry which combines human and robot skills to make production more flexible. Since the effective implementation of HRC requires a careful analysis of different aspects, related both to robots and humans, there is a real need for a structured methodology to support it. A previous work proposed a multi-dimensional framework to analyze several HRC aspects of a collaborative task. However, identifying the configuration that better exploits the HRC potential is not always trivial, especially among multiple alternative solutions. In addition, the priority levels (weights) assigned to the individual sub-dimensions of the framework, which identify specific design strategies, do not appear explicitly. The goal of this paper is to address these gaps, expanding the previous methodology and proposing the introduction of a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method (i.e., ELECTRE-II). The inclusion of a MCDA method allows designers to: (i) express importance weights for each sub-dimension of the framework, and (ii) generate a preference ranking through a structured comparison of alternative HRC configurations. The description is supported by a real industrial application in the automotive field, in which four alternative HRC configurations are analyzed by a team of experts providing a holistic analysis. © 2021, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

abstract={Fuzzy set theory has an important role in the evolution of multicriteria decision-making methods. Different kinds of fuzzy sets are used to handle different kind of uncertain situations. In this work, we have proposed a hybrid method to overcome the shortcomings of ELimination Et Choice Translating Reality 1 (ELECTRE 1), decision-making method by incorporating steps borrowed from VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method in Pythagorean fuzzy environment. ELECTRE 1 is easy to use and simple in calculations, but it is an outranking method, thereby it is not capable to rank all the alternatives. This method only provides ranking of few alternatives while ignoring the ranking of rest of the considered alternatives. In real-life scenario, sometimes ranking of all the considered alternatives may be required to make appropriate decisions. Therefore, to serve this facility in ELECTRE 1, we have proposed a hybrid method that combines the steps from ELECTRE 1 and VIKOR methods in Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Additionally, the proposed method considers a group of decision makers while calculating weights of different criteria accordingly. The proposed method is also implemented on a real-world problem. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The number of green energy options in different fields is growing because of the need for reducing energy consumption and eliminating gas emission. One of these options is the use of eco-friendly cars produced by various manufacturers. Given the many available options and conflicting evaluation criteria, evaluation of such options becomes complex, and different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches have been used to select the most suitable car in terms of eco-friendly car selection. Previous research has been somewhat limited with respect to consideration of interdependencies between evaluation criteria and multi-levels of preference. This paper proposes a new integrated MCDM approach with the capability for considering interdependent criteria for eco-friendly car evaluation and different levels of preference. An analytic network process (ANP) will be used to evaluate the levels of importance of interdependent criteria, and ELECTRE III will be modeled to include thresholds of preference. The introduced model, based on twenty-eight evaluation criteria, was demonstrated in a case study dealing with five alternative electric and hybrid cars. The results from this model were compared to a traditional decision-making method and better results were obtained from the model. The model can help users make proper decisions regarding their future car options in a comprehensive manner. Sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of the model under different setups. © 2021 University of Kuwait. All rights reserved.},

In this research, MVSA was conducted for spectral analysis of HyMap and Hyperion data after a proposed data reduction to overcome the mentioned problem. The data cloud was therefore clustered based on the spectral angle mapper and Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) based methods were used to determine the best threshold angle. Consequently, four indicators were applied as evaluation attributes for selecting the appropriate alternative, and “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” and “ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE)” were employed to finalize the decision. The methods resulted in 0.8 and 1.3 degrees as optimal spectral angles for HyMap and Hyperion, respectively. In this case, the image processing computational burden and the noise effect were considerably alleviated and the procedure led to accurate endmember identification. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper proposes a non-weighted maximal approach of multi-attribute risk assessment for production accidents, which comes from the Chinese practice of risk management rather than the theoretical weighted multi-attribute approach. The existing literature for risk assessment of pipeline accidents, there is an absence of or lack of explicit consideration of some special dimensions, i.e., environmental pollution as the important derivative disaster. The non-weighted maximal approach is described the maximum function among multiple criteria, which include fatalities, serious injuries, direct economic loss, and environment pollutions. The approach comes from the Chinese government official achievement assessment system with the characteristics of 'one ticket veto system for production safety', and has applied to ex ante assessing likelihood of the accident, and ex post holding the responsible for accidents. At last, applying the case of the Chinese Qingdao oil pipeline accident, the maximal approach is compared with the FN curve criterion, the ALARP principle and the ELECTRE TRI method. The results show that the maximal approach of production safety accident criterion pays more attention to the risk density or risk consequences, which follows the 'cask principle' and is much more useful controlling the risk when targeting the vulnerable links of engineering systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of the article was to present the model of integration and cooperation (hybridization) of selected methods of decision support as a specific research procedure. The model is the basis for the construction of the so-called decision-making dashboard, which is the main module of the academic, prototype version of the multi-criteria decision support system - DSS 3.0 [1], [2]. Three methods were hybridized: AHP/ANP and ELECTRE TRI included in the area of multi-criteria decision analysis and the method of identification and econometric evaluation based on multiple regression analysis. Due to the limited volume of the study, the description of the algorithms of these methods was abandoned. The focus was on defining the set of input data common to the above-mentioned methods and on the description of the integration process of the results of the decision analysis obtained with their use, indicating the effects of their synergy. The properties of the model are illustrated on a practical example of employee team assessment (case study). The decision making dashboard provided answers to some interesting questions. How is the ranking of employees shaped? What is the overall assessment of a given employee (or candidate for a position) compared to the results of the entire staff? What is the distribution of the number of assignments of the ranked employees to the established classes (profiles) of multi-criteria assessment?

abstract={By combining ideas from three-way decision theory, prospect theory, and several families of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, including ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, TODIM, and dominance-based rough set analysis (DRSA), we propose a new ranking-based MCDM method called 3RD. With respect to a single criterion, we construct a three-way ranking (i.e., trilevel ranking) of a set of decision alternatives by using an alternative as a reference in the sense of prospect theory and a family of three-way rankings from all alternatives. With respect to a set of criteria, we have multiple families of three-way rankings. By adopting the TODIM procedure, we introduce a ranking function to rank the set of alternatives according to these multiple families of trilevel rankings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Medical devices used in healthcare organizations are costly, and the process of selecting these devices requires considering multiple criteria such as effectiveness and ease of use. Careful selection of these devices is daunting since it entails the evaluation of various measures. This research investigates the selection process of the same type of medical devices, especially when alternatives are available, and the organization needs to make a good selection. A Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework based on the integration of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ELimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method is developed. The framework model includes 10 criteria, which are selected based on real-life inputs from professional physicians. Seven Ultrasound machines (referred to as alternatives) are evaluated using the developed framework. A case study is conducted on the best selection practice of an Ultrasound machine in a gynecology clinic based in the Kingdom of Jordan. Results revealed that the best and worst alternatives of ultrasound machines are identified and compared with all other options. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Assessment of hydropower projects with respect to sustainability criteria is a multidimensional and complex issue. It requires considering technical, environmental, and social parameters instead of purely economic ones in decision making for energy planning. The flexibility to consider several criteria and objectives simultaneously leads to the use of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods which are well accepted in the field of energy planning. This paper aims at applying MCDM methods in facilitating the decision makers to select the most sustainable hydropower projects in the Indian region by making real and logical choices based on eight important criteria selected from the literature that are compatible with sustainable development. To comprehensively rank hydropower projects three MCDM methods are applied i.e., the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II), and elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE III). Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to calculate the weights of criteria. All three methods are well adapted for sustainability assessment and ranked Sharavathi (A 9), Bhakra (A 2), and Upper Indravati (A 13) to be the most sustainable hydropower projects in India under the selected criteria. The study will be helpful in sustainable energy planning of hydropower projects with similar geographical conditions. ©2021 Croatian Operational Research},

Based on the regional characteristics, bibliography, and available data on artificial recharge, 13 constraints and 5 factors were hierarchically structured for the adequacy of artificial recharge. The factors are subdivided into two main groups: environmental factors and economic factors. The adopted methodology allows a preliminary assessment of a recharge site, by combining the weighted linear combination (WLC) and the Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a GIS. The results of this study show three potential candidate sites that are based on environmental factors, which in turn are more important than the economic factors.

abstract={Linguistic multiple attribute decision making (LMADM) has been widely used in different decision contexts to achieve a final solution, e.g., obtaining the ranking of alternatives. Evaluation information using linguistic scales in LMADM is usually expressed in simple discrete linguistic terms. In this paper, we consider that each simple linguistic term in LMADM actually has a continuous representation (denoted as a linguistic 2-tuple) whose rounding operation matches the linguistic term. Under such conditions, the ranking of alternatives based on simple linguistic terms may not be consistent with that based on linguistic 2-tuples. Thus, this paper studies the linguistic scale ranking consistency issue in LMADM under seven classical and commonly used decision rules: weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, weighted geometric averaging, ordered weighted geometric averaging, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE. We first define the concept of the linguistic scale ranking consistency in LMADM. Afterwards, several consistency conditions are presented analytically for the selected decision rules to guarantee the linguistic scale ranking consistency. Finally, we present detailed theoretical and simulation-based comparisons. The theoretical comparisons show the roles of decision rules and granularity in the consistency conditions, and the simulation-based comparisons demonstrate the performance of the selected decision rules in defending against the ranking inconsistency in LMADM.

abstract={Traditional publishing houses are being confronted with the online diffusion of e-books. This phenomenon has forced publishers to offer digital versions of their printed books. However, it would be inaccurate to envi-sion and report on the digital strategies of publishers in a global way, since the effect of digitization differs widely according to book type – for example, dictionaries, illustrated books, novels. This study examines whether, how and to what extent the types and categories of books influence the behaviour of publishers in terms of their digitization strategies and the design of their e-books. The results reflect divergent approaches to proactive behaviour and the appropriation of e-book technologies. Not all publishers are on the path to publishing in digital formats. The authors provide a comparative analysis of print and e-book catalogues. They compare the strategies of 104 publishers in one specific country: France. The most widely diffused book categories with the total number of titles available in print and digital formats are identified for each publisher. The analysis uses Electre, the national databank of French publishers. The results shed light on the influence of the digital book on printed book categories and make it possible to characterize the strategies of publishing houses in the digital age. © 2021, Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales.

abstract={Compromising the online social network account of a genuine user, by imitating the user's writing trait for malicious purposes, is a standard method. Then, when it happens, the fast and accurate detection of intruders is an essential step to control the damage. In other words, an efficient authorship verification model is a binary classification for the investigation of the text, whether it is written by a genuine user or not. Herein, a novel authorship verification framework for hijacked social media accounts, compromised by a human, is proposed. Significant textual features are derived from a Twitter-based dataset. They are composed of 16124 tweets with 280 characters crawled and manually annotated with the authorship information. XGBoost algorithm is then used to highlight the significance of each textual feature in the dataset. Furthermore, the ELECTRE approach is utilized for feature selection, and the rank exponent weight method is applied for feature weighting. The reduced dataset is evaluated with many classifiers, and the achieved result of the F-score is 94.4%. © 2021 Suleyman Alterkavi and Hasan Erbay.},

abstract={Maritime transport consists of moving goods or people mainly by sea. The sea route is one of the major channels through which goods are moved across the world. This mode of transport considers the loading and unloading of containers at ports. The best location of a container in a containership is very important for companies because this operation reduces transport costs. In this article, the authors propose an approach to the problem of container placement in a containership by using a multicriteria decision method named Electre II (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) to identify the best location of any container. Here, they consider four criteria: the container destination, the container weight, the departure date of the container and the container type. This method has as input a matrix of performance and gives a ranking of alternatives as an output. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to an ever-growing demand for spectrum and the fast-paced development of wireless applications, technologies such as cognitive radio enable the efficient use of the spectrum. The objective of the present article is to design an algorithm capable of choosing the best channel for data transmission. It uses quantitative methods that can modify behavior by changing quality parameters in the channel. To achieve this task, a hybrid decision-making algorithm is designed that combines analytical hierarchy process (AHP) algorithms and adjusts the weights of each channel parameter, using a priority table. The Elimination Et Choix Tranduisant La Realite (ELECTRE) algorithm processes the information from each channel through a weight matrix and then delivers the most favorable result for the transmitted data. The results reveal that the hybrid AHP-ELECTRE algorithm has a suitable performance, which improves the throughput rate by 14% compared to similar alternatives. © 2020. All rights reserved.},

As many criteria inform how such patients are being qualified for alloplasty procedures, this article proposes a multi-criteria decisional framework in qualifying patients for treatment while undergoing diagnostic analysis for hip replacement surgery. In order to assess the patient's health condition, the competence of physicians and physiotherapists must first be checked. After creating the expert preference model and decision tree, the AHP method was applied followed by the Electre Tri method in the next stage of verification. Integrating these analytic procedures, a group of patients can be quickly evaluated and meaningfully profiled. Specifically, these patients can be classified in respect of their condition determined during hospitalisation as per the severity of degenerative disease and on the basis of their subjective feelings and diagnostics. The proposed methodology promises to allow optimal treatment to be assigned while enabling the appropriate classification and verification within group of patients targeted for hip replacement surgery. © 2020 IGI Global.

abstract={The aim of the article is to present a solution to the research problem that addresses the selection of the opening cut location in the surface mining method. Selecting the opening cut location is a strategic mine planning matter and has a key impact on the overall processes occurring during mining operations. This choice is a complex, and at the same time, mathematically ill-defined issue. The selection procedure should take into account many, often opposing, perspectives of the interveners, who represent the criteria laid down by the technical and organisational, economic, as well as social and environmental groups. In order to be able to compare criteria of a different nature, the authors implemented a multi-criteria method as a solution, derived from operational research. The mathematical tool best suited to the characteristics of the issue of selecting the opening cut location is a method from the ELECTRE family, which was used to create the final solution ranking. The main achievement of the method presented is the specification of a complementary group of assessment criteria and the application of a method allowing a solution to be created, which results in the selection of the most favourable decision variant. The developed method supports decision-makers responsible for making investment decisions in the implementation of mining projects. © 2020 by the authors.},

The new stage uncovered organizational inefficiency in the Social Economy’s institutions that might put at riskh8 their survival and highlighted new challenges that these organizations had to face. It was necessary to move towards a strategic model that would allow them to respond more swiftly and effectively to external shocks without renouncing the values and principles of the Social Economy. This paper analyzes the effects of the 2008 crisis on the institutions of the Spanish non-profit sector and suggests a methodology to help them decide between different affordable future strategies.

abstract={Office layout design is pertinent in terms of ergonomics to obtain a sustainable workspace. There are five workplace evaluation parameters to be considered, namely successiveness, work within the limits of biological ability, work within the limits of sustainable work performance, work within the social limits, and work fulfilling psychological expectations and individual satisfaction of being able to exercise all abilities. In ergonomics, job satisfaction is an essential matter for an employee to perform a task productively. Since the office design mostly affects the worker’s performance and health at the same time, it is a requirement to create sustainable workplace. Multi-criteria decision-making methods are not only broadly used in different fields and disciplines, but are also considered to be an essential field in ergonomics. This paper aimed to propose a method in order to analyze and compare the office layout design with the methods of analytical hierarchy process, elimination and choice translating reality, and permutation method. The criteria in this paper are established in a hierarchical order by employing these methods.

abstract={The evaluation of multidimensional risk in natural gas pipelines is a topic of interest due to the possibility of human, environmental, and financial losses occurring. However, managing risks in pipeline systems might be a complex task due to the uncertainty inherent in the parameters of the model, being a factor that managers must take account. This requires more regular effort to be made to maintain safety conditions at stable levels, and for it to be borne in mind that pipeline sections at risk may be sensitive to both minor and major changes. Thus, this study undertakes a global sensitivity analysis based on a multidimensional assessment of risk, which uses ELECTRE TRI integrated into the Utility Theory approach, in order to classify sections of a natural gas pipeline into risk categories. For this analysis, parameters are set for operational, physical, and failure modes for different pipeline sections. The assessment is formulated to include preferences, graphical information and consequence modeling. Then, simulations are run to provide the decision-maker with relevant information, based on different settings of groups of parameters. From a graphical analysis appraisal, this paper gives the notion to the decision maker of sensitivity levels of each section and how sections are changing regarding their original risk class based on the variations tested. Thus, it is shown that, with the aid of procedures that evaluate risk under uncertainty, actions can be determined that lead to resources being applied better and more efficiently so as to guarantee acceptable safety levels for everyone and everything involved in a natural gas transportation system, thereby avoiding human, environmental, financial and company losses. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={The evaluation of multidimensional risk in natural gas pipelines is a topic of interest due to the possibility of human, environmental, and financial losses occurring. However, managing risks in pipeline systems might be a complex task due to the uncertainty inherent in the parameters of the model, being a factor that managers must take account. This requires more regular effort to be made to maintain safety conditions at stable levels, and for it to be borne in mind that pipeline sections at risk may be sensitive to both minor and major changes. Thus, this study undertakes a global sensitivity analysis based on a multidimensional assessment of risk, which uses ELECTRE TRI integrated into the Utility Theory approach, in order to classify sections of a natural gas pipeline into risk categories. For this analysis, parameters are set for operational, physical, and failure modes for different pipeline sections. The assessment is formulated to include preferences, graphical information and consequence modeling. Then, simulations are run to provide the decision-maker with relevant information, based on different settings of groups of parameters. From a graphical analysis appraisal, this paper gives the notion to the decision maker of sensitivity levels of each section and how sections are changing regarding their original risk class based on the variations tested. Thus, it is shown that, with the aid of procedures that evaluate risk under uncertainty, actions can be determined that lead to resources being applied better and more efficiently so as to guarantee acceptable safety levels for everyone and everything involved in a natural gas transportation system, thereby avoiding human, environmental, financial and company losses. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Matching forage supply to demand is a key issue in efficient pastoral production and one of the few tools that sheep and beef farmers have to manipulate supply is the mix of forages on their farm. With an extensive range of species and cultivars available, the problem of choosing which forage to sow can be daunting. This paper describes the planning, implementation, and release of ForageMaster®, a decision support and learning tool developed under a Meat &amp; Wool New Zealand (M&amp;WNZ) programme to provide advice on forage selection. Forage selection is a multi-criteria decision, using information relating to potential performance, ability to withstand any pests and diseases, and the function that the farmer wants the forage to perform. The ELECTRE III outranking method was selected as the core of the decision model. The inputs required by the decision model were lists of the criteria important to the user and the relative weights of these criteria. Using the ELECTRE III method, it was also possible to show users which of their criteria influenced the recommended forages and to see why some forages were excluded from consideration. This allowed users the opportunity to reflect on the criterion weightings that they selected and to see why the software selected particular forages. Forage selection decisions are made infrequently, so it was essential that the user interface for ForageMaster® be intuitive, that it requested information in a form that was readily available to users, and that it was robust. Considerable effort went into the design of the interface, and the design was tested with mentor groups to ensure that farmers found the information to be readily available to them and easy to understand. An example input screen is given in Figure 1. Software tools released without support are unlikely to be used to any significant degree. Over fifty workshops were therefore held throughout the country to discuss the many aspects of forage selection, establishment, and management, and help farmers learn to use the software in their decision processes. The workshops were designed using the principles of the AgCelerate® learning programme. While it is too early yet to state that ForageMaster® has been totally successful in its ultimate aim, to improve on-farm productivity, the degree of farmer interest in attending workshops using ForageMaster® suggests that the software will be well-used. The key steps in producing the ForageMaster® software were that: • it was ensured that the objective of the software aligned well with what farmer mentor groups wanted; • the software had a very intuitive interface; • the recommendations made by the software were presented in a manner that allowed the user to easily discover the rationale for the recommendations, and so build trust in the software; • the release of the software was accompanied by a large number of workshops, which the farmers had to attend if they wanted to get a copy of the software. Progress with ForageMaster® will be monitored, but at this stage it seems this has been a successful formula and one that is likely to be followed in development of future tools. © MODSIM 2005 - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making, Proceedings.

abstract={Roads are terrestrial communication paths specially designed for the movement of vehicles and pedestrians and part of the national transport system. Maintaining proper road conditions is essential for traffic safety and road network availability. There are a number of factors that impact the decision-making process regarding the road structure programme management, including the technical condition of the roads, traffic safety, heavy traffic, the cost of maintenance works and the low funding allocated to this sector. Thus, an effective approach is needed to attain a balance between the program of maintenance/repair/rehabilitation activities and the works that can be executed within the limits of the available funds, so that the investment achieves the highest profitability. This paper aims to analyze the technical state of the road network in Romania using a multi-criteria decision analysis method, namely Electre method. The method was applied on only four sectors of National Road 1 (the method requires a large number of parameters: weights and different thresholds assigned by the road network authorities) and aimed at identifying those road sections with the most severe conditions regarding the technical condition of the roads. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The goal of the paper is to present the use of multicriterial decision methods to assure the transparency of public acquisitions in the context of regional economic growth. Based on multiple criteria algorithms and using adequate methods to determine the importance of each criterion, a computer program was created to assist the decision maker. The software was created by the department of Mathematics and Computer Science of “Aurel Vlaicu” University of Arad and implements the procedure for public tenders. The application is designed both for Electre and Topsis models, without limitations in the number of alternatives or criteria. Besides describing the algorithm and the software, the paper deals with a case study: a public procurement in the field of road construction. In Romania, the financial support for road construction is provided by the administrative budget of the counties, using various funds: local taxes, public or private funds, EU financing. The contract is assigned to one of the applicant companies through a public acquisition process. The decision considers a set of criteria, in order to obtain the best quality to price ratio and applies the Electre multi-criteria decision-making model. Input data is obtained from the tenderers' files handed in by each applicant. Before running the algorithm, a careful financial background check of the applicant is conducted. In this case study, seven tenderers passed the eligibility check and were admitted to the final phase. A number of eight criteria were considered and weighted by the experienced staff of the county administration. The computer application was used for ranking the alternatives and to designate the winner of the tender through an independent and transparent acquisition process. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

abstract={The purpose of this research is to develop a novel approach to benchmark smart community health centers in order to achieve continuous improvement of service quality. Three methods are presented: the fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to determine the criteria weights, the fuzzy ELECTRE III method is employed to obtain the ranking of smart community health centers, and IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) is employed to formulate improvement strategies. The proposed approach clearly identifies the strengths and weakness of each smart community health center by ranking its performance with respect to a system of five service quality criteria. In addition, IPA is able to develop the most effective improvement strategies for each smart community health center. The proposed approach was applied to five smart community health centers in Beijing and service strengths and weakness are discussed. The proposed approach has three notable advantages. First, the novel approach can address ambiguity and uncertainty in the process of decision making. Second, interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria are analyzed by the fuzzy DEMATEL method, so that the weights obtained are more in line with reality. Third, the fuzzy ELECTRE III method considers non-compensatory behavior for service quality comparisons among smart community health centers. The novel fuzzy-based approach presented in this article is a powerful and highly effective tool to benchmark smart community health centers and develop successful improvement strategies of service quality. © 2013 IEEE.},

Its ease of use resulted in its wide adoption, and users are increasingly faced with a large choice of cloud services. In this context, we have developed the cloud service research and selection system (CSRSS) that allows users to specify the requirements of the cloud services they want and select those that best meet these requirements. The CSRSS uses an algorithm based on the Skyline and gave some encouraging first results. In this paper, we explore two approaches to improve the performance of the used algorithm and decrease its time complexity by reducing the number of I/O operations necessary to compute the Skyline.

However, this approach ignores other important concerns such as resilient implementation and running of a project that is a crucial aspect towards service continuity. This research presents a decision-making approach that helps managers to evaluate vendors profiles based on their submitted tenders to accomplish a proposed radio frequency identification (RFID)-based passport tracking system. First, this evaluation is conducted based on two sets of traditional and resilience criteria presented in a unified framework based on literature and the case company’s experts. Second, the weights of identified criteria are quantified by using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) algorithm. Third, the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) algorithm is applied to evaluate the performance of vendors to recommend the best one. Four employees from the case company participated in evaluating the applicability of the proposed decision-making tool. This includes the selection of one vendor out of 6 submitted their proposals to implement RFID-based passport tracking system. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Unbalanced resource distribution of resources in offsite construction can cause lot of production environment problems s as insufficient productivity, overruns of deadlines and quality pitfalls, resulting in overruns of cost and time. Efficient management particular importance of specific tools, crosstraining and multiskilling of off-site construction work to understand the different advantages over conventional construction. Though extensive research in the manufacturing industry has been conducted to tackle unbalanced allocation of resources. The current study hypothesized to bridge gap that multi-skilling and crosstraining of building resources could offer a cost efficient solution to the problem. The goal of this research was to investigate the degree to which operational benefits can be achieved in off-site construction by using different labour skills structures to solve production problems. To compare performance measures associated with different sets of labour skills, a hybrid research method that adopts optimization and decision-making techniques with multicriteria was employed. To this end, multiskilling policies have been ranked and situations have been discussed in which ranking results can be changed. The findings of this study show the efficiency and sensitivity of various multiskilling approaches related to various parameters. This study assists industry practitioners in workforce planning and offsite construction management. It also contributes to the body of knowledge by quantifying the interaction between performance measures and labour skill sets. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods have developed to accommodate different types of applications. Dozens of methods have been developed, with even minor variations to existing methods leading to the creation of new branches of research. This paper conducts study on common Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the listed methods, and describes how their specific implementations are linked to their relative strengths and weaknesses.

In this study, water allocation has been considered as a multicriteria decision making problem. Meeting the multiple objectives, four irrigation districts have been ranked by using a multicriteria decision making technique ELECTRE. Sensitivity analysis for the applied methodology showed that changing the relative weights of the criteria produce no changes to the final rankings. However, the choice of concordance and discordance thresholds has some impact on the final ranking of the districts. This concludes that ELECTRE is not very sensitive to criteria weighting and can provide objective estimates of optimal water allocations. © HWRS 2006.},

abstract={The field of e-government has been an attractive area of ontology development in the past years, resulting in an increase in the number of e-government ontologies on the web. The availability of these ontologies gives the opportunity to reuse them in future e-government projects rather than trying to develop similar ontologies de novo. This study aims to promote the selection and reuse of e-government ontologies on the web, through the provision of a ranked list of existing e-government ontologies on the basis of their quality metrics. A number of 23 e-government ontologies are downloaded on the web and their quality metrics are computed with the OntoMetrics online ontology evaluation environment. Thereafter, a decision making algorithm is applied to rank the e-government ontologies based on the aggregation of their quality metrics. The decision scheme is constituted of the 23 e-government ontologies or alternatives and their 11 quality metrics or attributes. The experimental results yielded an ordered list of the 23 inputs e-government ontologies ranked according to their quality metrics. This may provide some insights on the selection and reuse of these ontologies in future e-government projects. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Choosing an order picking strategy is one of the most important decisions related to warehouse management. Making this decision properly can lead to high standards of efficiency, since order picking represents more than a half of a wholesale and retail organization’s operational costs and consumes a huge amount of the resources allocated to warehouse labor. Moreover, some productivity and service-oriented objectives related to order picking are sometimes conflicting, and require managers’ preferences to be considered, thus making the decision problem multi-objective and complex. We put forward a multicriteria decision model based on the ELECTRE III method that supports how to choose an order picking strategy. It takes managers’ preferences into consideration and integrates all the core elements for assessing how picking is being performed. Results showed that the model is able to identify the strategy that yields the best compromise between the objectives of productivity and the service-oriented ones, and that this strategy also represents the organization’s aims. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Road accidents have become a major social and health problem for being dramatically increasing day after day worldwide. Scientists are conducting their studies to define the main attributes that share the severity of road accidents. Finding a new approach to analyze road accidents is of great urgency. Data mining techniques are best fitting to discover useful information out of enormous data which are used to make proactive decisions. Methods: This paper tempts a rule-based machine learning method known as association rule mining, which can identify strong rules discovered in databases using interesting measures. Given a da-ta-set from the Lebanese territory for the years 2016-2017, the application of association rule mining, the Apriori method takes its place. However, its implementation leads to a very large number of rules. The task that is the most difficult is extracting meaningful and non-redundant rules. In order to find out the most interesting and relevant rules out of fatal rules such, ELECTRE TRI and PROME-THEE methods, the most significant methods of decision making, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) are integrated to resolve the outranking problem. The integration is presented by the use of the same set of weights and the same constant values of Indifference and Preference thresholds used in ELECTRE-TRI method to define the linear preference function needed by PROMETHEE method. Realizing the sensitivity of the final output of alternatives ranking to the changes of the input parameters of the decision-making tool, this proposed integration helps the decision makers to overcome their ambivalence between preference and indifference thresholds and to cope adequately with the issue of the uncertainty of MCDA procedures; it comes up with the complete ranking of rules. Results: The obtained ranked rules declare the most significant attributes or combinations of attributes that influence the severity of road accidents. Four main factors of fatal road accidents are pinpointed: over-speeding mainly leading up to rollover crashes, pedestrians encountering in the context, distracted driving leading to fatal road vehicle collisions with Pedestrian victims; and wet roads particularly in the case of single car accidents. Meanwhile, the importance of ELECRE-TRI and PROMETHEE and their integration in dealing with such complex phenomena and corresponding database with a large number of involved attributes have been validated. Conclusion: This paper studies the phenomenon of road accidents. Association rule mining has been applied to discover all possible relations between the various attributes. The integration of ELEC-TRE-TRI and PROMETHEE MCDA techniques aims at extracting meaningful information from the big dataset. The obtained results have shown how influencing the behavior of the driver is on the occurrence of fatal road accidents. These findings contribute to supporting decision makers to draw new design conceptions for road infrastructure and develop preventive measures that improve road safety in Lebanon. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

In the proposed method, three indexes – concordance index, non-concordance index and credibility index – are defined first. Based on these indexes, the preference evaluation matrix is constructed, and consistent credibility, non-consistent credibility and net credibility are computed second. Third, it was sorted for the quality of all alternatives according to the value of group net credibility. In general, the greater the value of the group net credibility of a project, the better the project is. Simulation experiments suggest that this proposed method is feasible and valid.

abstract={Information security is a global problem and has attracted worldwide attention. Information security risk assessment is of great significance to understand the information security situation clearly and put forward pertinent measures. Information security risk assessment is system engineering, involving standards, technology, management and other factors. Owing to the complexity and uncertainty of information system, information system security assessment inevitably involves a certain degree of fuzziness. This paper brings forward the information system security assessment model based on improved Electre method with linguistic variables. First, a two-level index system for information system security is constructed based on the feasibility and maneuverability condition. Second, linguistic variables are adopted to represent evaluation values of second-level indicators and WAA operator is adopted to calculate the evaluation values for first level indicators. Then the improved Electre method is adopted to evaluate and rank the alternatives. The Results show that the improved Electre method is more effective and more practical for security risk assessment of information system. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={An approach is considered that allows one to make a decision on the choice of compositions of composite materials that have been exposed to temperature changes for a long time. The alternatives are considered-compositions of materials and special criteria, the analysis of which underlies the optimal choice of composition from the group under consideration. Proposed the formation of criteria by which the decision is made to assess the quality of building composite materials. In this article, the criteria are formed on the basis of such properties of building materials as hardness and modulus of elasticity on the surface of the test samples, which were subject to negative and positive temperature extremes. Criteria for each property of the sample are formed on the basis of the given values relative to the starting point of exposure. To make a decision about the quality of composite materials, it is proposed to form three criteria for each of the considered properties of materials. The first criterion is calculated as a change in the corresponding property relative to the initial exposure point. The second criterion is determined sequentially with respect to each exposure point by a change in each of the considered properties. The third criterion is represented as the sum of the first two criteria. After that, some provisions of the ELECTRE methods are applied for ranking the studied compositions of composite materials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This research maps buildings which are potential to be vertical shelter in Padang. According to the Regional Disaster Management Agency of Padang, there are 62 buildings which can be used as shelter. The parameters used to determine the buildings which can be used as vertical shelter are the building locations measured by the distance of the building to the shoreline, the capacity, the height of the building and the length of time required for tsunami evacuation. The system is made using the Election et Choix Traduisant La Realite (ELECTRE) method to determine buildings which are potential to be vertical shelter location. The system worked in Padang Utara Sub- district. The results show that 5 shelters from 8 public shelters can be used as a place for evacuation, with an estimated capacity of approximately 21,000 people. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS},

abstract={In this article, we offer a novel multicriteria decision analysis method for the segmentation of the market. The proposed method combines the analysis of preferences of the customer and the application of decision aiding on the segmentation problem. To explore the preferences of each customer in a strong way, the method applies the aggregation-disaggregation paradigm and a genetic algorithm to derive multiple sets of preference parameters of the ELECTRE III method compatible with the preference information supplied by each customer. Next, the preferences of each customer are characterized by the dispersion of potential rankings of products by applying the derived valued outranking relations. A novel metric is used to quantify the similitude among preferences of diverse customers, and a procedure of clustering is established to complete the segmentation of the market. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Data management used in a cloud environment is always challenging. Data replication is a well-known data management technique that has been commonly adopted by cloud systems as an effective solution to achieve good performance in terms of response time, load balancing and most importantly, high data availability and reliability. To maximize the benefit of data replication, replicas placement and replacement in the system is critical. Several replica placement strategies have been proposed in the literature; some of them were based on criteria such as: mean service time, failure probability, load variance, latency, storage usage and other. For each criterion is assigned a weight by the user which reflects the importance of each criterion. We propose in this paper an original approach based on a multi-criteria decision analysis model called ELECTRE-I (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality). This modeling allows us to improve the selection of the candidate site for replica placement, which have a good impact on the simulation results, and improve performances. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The thermochemical nonequilibrium effect refers to the complicated physical and chemical processes of gas during hypersonic flights. The surrounding gas is heated to a very high temperature. The properties of gas change due to the high temperature, thus leading to the thermochemical nonequilibrium effect. The thermochemical nonequilibrium effect is critical for hypersonic aerodynamic design and optimization. Possibility of graphics processor units (GPUs) parallel computation technique for the simulation of hypersonic flows is also demonstrated. To cure the shock instability in the simulation of hypersonic thermochemical nonequilibrium flows, a shock-stable HLLC-type scheme is introduced. A ELECTRE cone test case is conducted in NVIDIA GTX Titan Black GPU to validate the accuracy and efficiency of this proposed GPU accelerated thermochemical nonequilibrium solver. Numerical result demonstrates that the simulation time is greatly shortened and the accuracy of hypersonic flows is improved. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={It is generally accepted that the choice of the best technical solutions in the design of complex technical systems must be carried out on the basis of a multi-criteria approach. However, it is known that at the initial design stages, developers, as a rule, do not have exact values of basic technical indicators. Moreover, many (if not all) indicators are qualitative in nature, and the probability of making a non-optimal decision increases due to the uncertainty of the initial data. Therefore, it is advisable to try to restrict the choice domain, eliminating the deliberately "uncompetitive" objects. In the well-known ELECTRE method, for this purpose, some "preference" relation is introduced, indirectly determined by the choice of "weights" of particular quality indicators and threshold values of the so-called concordance and discordance indices. Unfortunately this approach is characterized by the lack of a clear operational sense of the weights and thresholds introduced, as well as the possible occurrence of oriented cycles in the preference relation graph. This makes it difficult to interpret the results of applying the procedure for excluding "worst" objects by the ELECTRE method. In this regard, the article proposes a new approach to the problem of choice domain restriction. On the set of the objects under consideration, some irreflexive and asymmetric dominance relation is constructed, allowing a solution according to von Neumann-Morgenstern, which simultaneously is also the so-called C-core. At the same time, the considered dominance relation-unlike the preference relation in the ELECTRE method already mentioned-has a clear "physical" meaning and does not require the introduction of any directly immeasurable parameters like "weights" and "thresholds," which always question the adequacy of the model to actual decision maker's preferences system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Railway transport plays a significant role in shaping the quality of the environment. Vibration from railways is a big concern for engineers. Because of its negative impact on the surrounding area, it is also an environmental problem. The paper deals with the dependence of speed on the level of vibration emission. It based on the experimental study, which was done during the passage of the Pendolino train (EMU 250). Accredited Laboratory of Structural Mechanics at Cracow University of Technology has performed in situ measurements. Speed of the train was varying between 80 and 250 km/h. The evaluated construction was located at distance of approximately 50 m from the railroad. Indicators of the perceptibility of vibration through constructions (WODB) were used to access the impact of vibrations on the building. The innovation of this publication is the application of multi-criteria decision analysis methods for assessing the impact of vibration. The ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) methods to evaluate the increase in vibration emission depending on the speed for each frequency band are used. The limits specified by Polish standards in any of the passages have not been exceeded. As proven in the paper, a train speed increase does not uniformly make the vibration higher in each frequency band. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Regulatory governance is considered as a new era in the state's intervention, and it is vital to foster both qualitative and quantitative performances of regulators. In this paper, the authors argue that the absence of governance principles allows regulators to justify the adoption of instruments to improve it. Five core regulatory principles, particularly accountability, administrative capacity, open government, regulatory quality, and rule of law build the bridge between regulatory governance and regulatory substance. The authors propose the application of a multicriteria modelling method (ELECTRE TRI-C) in order to conduct the assessment and categorization of Brazilian subnational regulators according to the presence of governance, encompassing the opinions of legitimate stakeholders. The levels of regulatory governance are calculated for the regulators in order to provide some determinants of good governance, which could be stimulated by regulatory impact assessment, as a policy tool that improves institutional environments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Infrastructure management renders a number of decision-making problems from assets condition inspections to maintenance planning and resources optimisation. Since management of infrastructure pertains to not only technical requirements but also to societal and economic developments, these decision problems have multiple and often conflicting objectives. Various methods of MCDA based on the decision theory and game theory are proposed to aid-in decision-making problems. Owing to the wide area of applications and extensive variation in MCDA methodology, the selection of appropriate MCDA method pertaining to the specific needs of infrastructure management and decision maker is a difficult task. In this paper, two synthesis-based methods (i.e. AHP and MAUT) and an outranking method (i.e. ELECTRE III) is applied on same maintenance decision making problem to evaluate them for their scalability, ease of use, risk consideration, and few other aspects. The results of evaluation suggest that a) without a computerised tool the scalability of these methods is tedious task b) only MAUT considers the risk attitude of a decision maker c) AHP and MAUT both require the data to be converted to definite scale for analysis, for instance, to Saaty scale of comparison and to utility functions respectively and d) unlike other two, ELECTRE works on preference structure and yields partial pre-orders. These aforementioned results are obtained by application of AHP, MAUT, and ELECTRE III on the maintenance planning decision problem of 22 road bridges from Netherlands road network. Despite the inherent methodology differences of these methods, the result of case study shows minor difference in ranking yielded by considered MCDA methods. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={The electronic commerce (e-commerce) market is experiencing explosive growth. Millions of retail network firms compete in the virtual e-commerce market. A key aspect of online trading is emotional intelligence: these retail firms adopt emotional tactics to attract and retain customers. This article evaluates the emotional intelligence of small retail e-commerce network firms. By analyzing the emotional information transmitting process, we propose a framework to measure virtual emotional intelligence abilities in e-commerce. Based on that framework, we adopt the ELECTRE III multicriteria evaluation method to evaluate the emotional intelligence of some small retail network firms on the TAOBAO e-commerce website. The results show that a correlation exists between emotional intelligence and sales in a network environment. Thus, improving virtual emotional intelligence abilities is important for retail network firms to increase customers' satisfaction, gain competitive advantage, and promote their sales in the current information society. © 2019 Jianfeng Li et al.},

abstract={The healthcare providers have tremendously grown during the past decade. Selecting a healthcare provider based on patient's preference is really a great challenge. The purpose of this paper is to provide an IT enabled framework that will help the patients to find a suitable healthcare provider based on their preferences. The patients' preferences in selecting a healthcare provider differ based on their geographical region, gender, age and socio-economic background. Discovering a set of feasible healthcare providers and selecting the most appropriate healthcare provider based on the patient preferences can be modelled as a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this article, a novel patient friendly framework is proposed for selecting the best healthcare provider. Even with a huge dataset, the results show that the proposed framework is robust, reliable, faster and effective. The analysis reveals that the number of preferences and the healthcare providers influence the healthcare selection time. Case studies on 500 patients from different geographical regions reveal that the proposed framework is effective. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The long-term prospect of the company's progress is determined by the quality of human resources (HR), The urgency to maintain the company's survival it takes a reliable and futuristic leader. Measuring tool that can be used is none other than the performance of human resources. Of course with potential leaders will provide the vision of the company's mission to grow and expand. Leadership selection process can be done with promotion positions based on performance preference. The purpose of this research is to conduct selection of performance promotion based on performance using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) selection methods such as Analytic Hiererachy Process (AHP), VIKOR, ELECTRE, and Promethee, in addition to proving the result of a number of methods based on MCDM such as AHP for the determination of preferences data design, while for data analysis using three methods that will be compared the results of VIKOR, ELECTREE and Promethee. The measurable performance bases for promotional positions are viewed from seven criteria described in the modeling hierarchy using the concept of analytic hierararchy process in the discussion of this paper. The results obtained provide an interpretation that the promethee method is closer to the actual results, while the vikor method is almost close to the results of truth and far away when compared with the electre method. Thus, it can be concluded that the best method for placing employee positions is promethee method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Facility planning is concerned with the design, layout, and accommodation of people, machines and activities of a system. Most of the researchers try to investigate the production area layout and the related facilities. However, few of them try to investigate the relationship between the production space and its relationship with service departments. The aim of this research to is to integrate different approaches in order to evaluate, analyse and select the best facilities planning method that able to explain the relationship between the production area and other supporting departments and its effect on human efforts. To achieve the objective of this research two different approaches have been integrated: Apple's layout procedure as one of the effective tools in planning factories, ELECTRE method as one of the Multi Criteria Decision Making methods (MCDM) to minimize the risk of getting poor facilities planning. Dalia industries have been selected as a case study to implement our integration the factory have been divided two main different area: the whole facility (layout A), and the manufacturing area (layout B). This article will be concerned with the manufacturing area layout (Layout B). After analysing the data gathered, the manufacturing area was divided into 10 activities. There are five factors that the alternative were compared upon which are: Inter department satisfactory level, total distance travelled for workers, total distance travelled for the product, total time travelled for the workers, and total time travelled for the product. Three different layout alternatives have been developed in addition to the original layouts. Apple's layout procedure was used to study and evaluate the different alternatives layouts, the study and evaluation of the layouts was done by calculating scores for each of the factors. After obtaining the scores from evaluating the layouts, ELECTRE method was used to compare the proposed alternatives with each other and with the existing layout; ELECTRE compares the alternatives based on their concordance and discordance indices. The alternatives were ranked from best to worst where regarding to the layouts concerned with the manufacturing area B.4 is the best alternative. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The ELECTRE method is chosen because it is able to select the best alternative from the existing alternatives. This research used seven criteria as reference in determining for recipient candidate for PAMSIMAS program. The number of incidents of diarrheal diseases in one year (number of incidents), the number of people who have not used safe drinking water (individual), the number of people who have not used the toilet, the financial ability of the region, the income of the villagers, the distance of the source of clean water from the settlement, the availability of clean water. In addition to the criteria is also used the quality of the criteria to determine the best alternative and from the calculation of the alternative obtained the greatest value contained in A4 with value E = 4 and alternative A5 with the value E =4 thereby alternatives 4 and 5 are viable alternatives to the prospective recipient villages of the PAMSIMAS program in Pringsewu district. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Several studies state that competitiveness of international markets and the speed of technological evolution require companies to master and transfer their knowledge for greater performance and flexibility. Organizational performance often depends more on an ability to turn knowledge into effective action and less on knowledge itself (Alavi and Leidner 2001). This can result from good or bad choice concerning Knowledge Management tools. In this article, we focus on training as a frequently used knowledge management tool and propose a decision aid model for comparing training methods and choosing the most adequate one for each situation. Multi-criteria decision support methods have been in widespread use for a long time. The model, presented herein, is based on a combination of ELECTRE 1 method and the First Principles developed by Merrill in 2002. An application to industrial cases supports how this model can be useful for companies looking for more efficiency. Two types of training are studied and concerned consecutively Tacit and Explicit Knowledge. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={With the intensification of chronical disease within older people, concurrent use of different drugs (polypharmacy) is becoming increasingly frequent. However, there is no established manner to determine whether polypharmacy is appropriate or not. We propose an original method of classifying polypharmacy using multi-criteria decision-aid methods. To do this, we provided clinicians with a list of drugs that could be potentially prescribed to the typical elderly person suffering from three diseases (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure). Clinicians expressed their opinion on a 5-point Likert scale, allowing for hesitation between two or more answers. They evaluated risks, benefits, and impacts of each drug on the patient’s quality of life. We then aggregated these evaluations in order to obtain, for each drug, a multi-criteria evaluation vector representing the collective opinion of the clinicians consulted.

abstract={The European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation aims to facilitate the collaboration between public and private sectors in delivering innovation. To achieve this goal, Union Research and Innovation Programme provides various financial instruments, among which the Horizon 2020 is one of the most significant. Since its implementation, the Horizon 2020 has stimulated the interest of several research organizations making the partnerships among companies their core business for improving local economy. In this context, technological districts are the main proponents of research and innovation spreading in the local territory. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district exploited these opportunities, undertaking the strategic “Call for ideas” proposal with the aim of building its own roadmap for research and innovation. To such an aim, AgroBioPesca collected several innovative project ideas coherent with some Technological Trajectories (TT) provided by Horizon 2020 and in line with the national and local operational programmes. These project ideas have been evaluated by a technical and scientific committee, taking into account specific criteria related to the Horizon 2020 technical guidelines. This paper aims to select the AgroBioPesca best projects portfolio by applying the multiple criteria sorting method (MCSM) ELECTRE TRI. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted in order to verify the robustness of the solutions obtained. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

abstract={Some decision aiding methods are based on constructing and exploiting outranking relations. An alternative a outranks another b if a is at least as good as b (aSb). One well known method in this field is ELECTRE. The outranking relation is usually built by means of a weighted average (WA) of the votes given by a set of criterion with respect to the fulfilment of aSb. The value obtained represent the strength of the majority opinion. The WA operator can be observed to have sometimes an undesired compensative effect. In this paper we propose the use of other aggregation operators with different mathematical properties. In particular, we substitute the WA by three operators from the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) family of operators because it permits to decide the degree of andness/orness that is used during the aggregation. The OWAWA (Ordered Weighted Average Weighted Average), WOWA (Weighted Ordered Weighted Average) and IOWA (Induced Ordered Weighted Average) operators are studied. They are capable to combine the importance given to each criterion with the conjunctive/disjunctive requirement applied in the definition of the outranking relation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={This paper presents a new approach to semantic recommender systems. The data analysed consists on a set of alternatives described by means of a list of tags. Each tag corresponds to one concept in a domain ontology. The first contribution of this work is the use of a multi-criteria outranking method to evaluate, rank and filter a set of alternatives. The second contribution is a procedure for exploiting the topology of the ontology to create a set of numerical criteria and represent the user's preferences about the concepts related to these criteria. The solution proposed reduces the computing time and converts a semantic problem into a multi-criteria numerical problem that can be solved using the ELECTRE method.

abstract={Spanish public hospitals funding depends on the classification of attended pathologies. These pathologies are grouped thanks to a patient classification system (PCS) into the so-called diagnostic related groups (DRGs). International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding systems generate various DRGs. Based on the ICD-9, the all patients diagnostic related groups (AP-DRGs) were used. In January 2016, Spain adopted ICD-10. One of the casualties from this transition was the AP-DRG PCS which did not accept information coded with ICD-10. A new system had to be adopted. In this paper we develop a methodology to assist decision-makers who are charged with evaluating and determining replacement PCS in the context of scarce resources and limited hospital funding. We ground our approach in a rigorous analytical framework is order to understand the pros and cons of candidate systems, from both clinical and managerial perspectives. We propose a multicriteria decision-aiding approach based on the outranking method, ELECTRE III to produce a ranking of the different options. The methodology is applied to a case study of a Spanish hospital where the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 has already occurred. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of a computational fluid dynamics validation exercise using the NESHYP hypersonic multigrid real gas Navier-Stokes program including several compressible corrections within the "baseline" Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. We first address typical building block experiments on a 2D compression ramp geometry and subsystem like a 3D cone-flare configuration with and without roughness-induced transition, to study shock wave turbulent boundary layer interaction. Then we address the simulation of two typical orbital transfer lifting body reentry vehicles like the Dream Chaser shuttle and the X37B Boeing space plane. The numerical results are compared with in-house wind-tunnel aerodynamic test campaigns in the hypersonic regime at Mach 4.8, 6.2, 8 and 10, performed on generic blunt cone flares and on the two lifting body reentry vehicles models of the Dream Chaser and the X37B with variable body-flap trim angle. Accurate heat transfer predictions are also demonstrated on the standard Electre blunt cone international test-case of the European Space Agency at ONERA F4 arcjet real-gas M=8.7 conditions, and also for the hyperboloid approximation of the windward centerline of the full-scale US orbiter Columbia flight test STS-2 at reentry conditions M=25 Z=71km. For all the simulations a very good agreement with experiments is obtained. Finally we describe the implementation of a infrared thermography camera in the IAI HYWT to compare with NESHYP body-flap reattachment heating levels with and without discrete roughness. © 2018 Israel Annual Conference on Aerospace Sciences.

abstract={It is preferable to remove as much raw material in as short time as possible when processing materials using rough turning methods. Selecting the correct cutting tool at the beginning of the process is very important as this reduces the amount of material requiring later processing, in turn reducing the number of turning tools required, the number of tool changes and the total time taken to make a piece. In this paper, we present a system for selecting the best tools for external longitudinal turning. We take into account the characteristics of the machine, the power needed for cutting, the geometry and technological characteristics of the tools, and the machining parameters. Selection of the best tool for rough machining is made based on the processing time, the percentage of material to be cut, the cost of the tools and the number of tool changes. We ranked eight tools and used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method for multi-criteria optimisation then evaluated the results using ELECTRE II methods. The weight criteria were estimated using Saaty’s pairwise comparison scale. © 2017, Strojarski Facultet. All rights reserved.},

In consequence, the Weighted Overlap Dominance (WOD) method is examined, which has been explicitly designed for interval data, thus satisfying the proposed axioms, and clearly identifying the preference relational situation for all pairs of alternatives. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a method of choosing the "optimal" alternative, both under certainty and under uncertainty, based on relevant analysis criteria. Taking into account that a product can be assimilated to a system and that the reliability of the system depends on the reliability of its components, the choice of product (the appropriate system decision) can be done using the "ELECTRE" method and depending on the level of reliability of each product. In the paper, the "ELECTRE" method is used in choosing the optimal version of a wind turbine required to equip a wind farm in western Romania. The problems to be solved are related to the current situation of wind turbines that involves reliability problems. A set of criteria has been proposed to compare two or more products from a range of available products: Operating conditions, Environmental conditions during operation, Time requirements. Using the ELECTRE hierarchical mathematical method it was established that on the basis of the obtained coefficients of concordance the optimal variant of the wind turbine and the order of preference of the variants are determined, the values chosen as limits being arbitrary. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The ABC classification represents one of the most frequently used analysis in production and inventory management domains. This analysis is applied to categorize a set of items in three predefined classes A, B and C, where each class follows a specific management and control policies, in order to generate companies financial well-being. This paper introduces a new approach for the multi-criteria inventory classification based on the hybridization of the Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) with the multi-criteria decision making method namely Electre III. The evolutionary algorithm (DE) attends to learn and optimize the Electre III input parameters (criteria weights). The Electre III method generates a ranking score for all the inventory items and an ABC distribution dispatches all these items into three ordered classes A, B, C, forming a complete classification. An inventory cost function is used thereafter to evaluate each established classification. This function is based on different inventory costs and service level measurement and also represents the objective function of our model, which consists of minimizing the inventory cost. The highlight of our proposed hybridization approach DE-Electre III is the exploitation of the robustness and efficiency of used techniques. Based on generated results, our model provided encouraging results in the ABC MCIC problem. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The appropriate selection of cloud services is a new need that resulted from the increased use of Cloud Computing. Users want to find the cloud services that best meet their requirements from a large number of available cloud services. This requires a special treatment. Generally, it is done by using various techniques, such as Similarity, Data Mining, Recommender Systems, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, etc. The main problem of these cited methods, is firstly the large number of returned services and secondly the absence of direct communication between the user and the system. Most of methods are based on previous system knowledge, or they rely on other users feedback. In order to avoid these weaknesses we thought to add a form of communication between the user and the system. For this end, in our contribution, the user is requested to enter the values of his ideal service and then based on the techniques of clustering, the services which are the most closest to the ideal service are selected and returned to the final user. © 2016 ACM.},

First, ELECTRE-III is transformed into a continuous smooth function of each parameter vector. Then, robustness analysis structure and a parameters inferring algorithm are provided by maximizing robustness margin based on mathematics programming. Moreover, how to resolve the programming problem is also discussed.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide to the entrepreneurs, and propose to the scientific community, a newly structured knowledge system that includes the quality of customers and suppliers, to facilitate learning processes about the current state of the enterprise and new strategic approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The knowledge system is elaborated combining a long day-by-day experience in a specific Italian field [the independent after market (IAM)] with the theoretical knowledge of both economic and financial issues and multiple criteria (MC) methods of decision aid. The economic and financial key performance indicators are generated ad hoc for a specific sector and created with the concept that a company is in the center of a network composed of its suppliers, customers, competitors and the State. An MC model easily and consistently includes aspects that are different in terms of source and formal language. An MC method transparently synthesizes all these elements in relation to a specific decision problem. Integrating the potential of MC models and methods with economic and financial issues and context experience facilitates an effective knowledge transfer to the operators of the sector. Findings: This methodology is oriented to the companies involved in the IAM and in particular to the manufacture, distributor and spare parts dealer categories (in Italy, almost 500 manufacturers, 150 distributors and 5,000 dealers). Manufacturers can use the methodology and its results to know the economic and financial performances of their customers, distributors can identify their strengths and weaknesses and the situation of their competitors and dealers can identify the most reliable future partners. Also, foreign manufacturers may be interested in this analysis, before selling in Italy, and banks and financiers could consult our knowledge frameworks to analyze the risk default. Originality/value: The added value of this approach is to allow even small and medium enterprises, without an internal know-how for economic analyses, to use tools that clarify their relations with the interested parties of the macroeconomic system and facilitate the quality assessment of their portfolio of customers/suppliers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The social and economic activity steadily growing in our cities creates a significant waste production in constantly evolving. The management of this waste is problematic because it is the center of many issues and interests. Indeed, any action or decision to the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste should be considered in the economic, social, political and especially environmental aspect. A global Geomatic solution requires implementing a GIS with powerful multidimensional spatial analysis tools that support really waste management problem. Algeria has adopted a solution of waste landfill for all urban cities. In the Oran region, it exists three Centers Controlled landfill (CET) which the most important is that of Hassi-Bounif. This center currently meeting the needs of the region is unsustainable solution at the long-term because of its rapid saturation and its geographic location, which is still far from city centers (20-30 km) implying a negative impact on the vehicle park collecting such frequent breakdowns, the rapid degradation, slow delivery time and especially the high cost of the maintenance operation. This phenomenon is aggravated by the absence of real and actual initiatives targeting the recycling and recovery of waste, which makes the CET an endpoint for all types of waste. We present in this study, the use of the ELECTRE method (Multicriteria Analysis) integrated into a GIS to characterize the impact of the implementation of transfers centers at Oran region. The results of this study will accentuate the advantages of the activation of waste warehouse closer to the city, and relieving considerably the volume of transfer towards CET. The objective of our presentation is to show the leading role of the new Geomatics tools and the multidimensional spatial analysis in the apprehension of an environmental problem such the waste management and more generally in the urban management. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={In this study, it is attempted to rank plant species in order to stabilize sand by the application of ELECTRE, and Liner assignment methods in Rig, Sirjan, Iran. The results suggest that in linear assignment method among 7 plant species, milk vetch species is in the first ranking with one score, and is the best species to stabilize sand in the studied area and the Camel's thorn species lies at the bottom of the ranking chart and can't be suitable for sand stabilization. Artichoke, Espand, Glasswort, Sagebrush and Charkha lie in the next rankings respectively by their importance. In ELECTRE method, among 7 plant species studied in this research, the milk vetch species with four dominances and one defeat with 3 scores is in the first ranking and the Camel's thorn and Artichoke species with five defeats and no dominance with (-5) score lie at the bottom of the ranking. Glasswort, Charkha, Espand and Sagebrush with (1,1,1,3) dominances and (4,4,4,2) defeats with (-3,-3,-3,1) scores respectively lie in the next ranks. It should be noticed that Artichoke, Camel's thorn, Glasswort, Charkha and Espand species must be omitted because the number of their dominances were less than the number of their defeats. The results of the linear method were more compatible with reality and were more accurate and precise. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.},

It is shown that the heatflux results are consistent with flight data. Then the detailed flow features of a hypersonic flow around the forebody of the sphere-cone vehicle under different attack angle, altitude and Mach number under catalytic and non-catalytic boundaries are studied. As is shown, the real gas effects are mainly prominent in some regions of quite thin shock wave layers closing to the wall surface, and make the outstanding distance of shock wave short. The heat flux under full catalytic wall boundary condition is higher than that under non-catalytic condition, the bigger the attack angle, the more obvious this variance and the less electron number density on the wall. The higher the flight altitude, the lower oxygen dissociationand nitrogen and the heat flux on the stagnation point. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have various applications in real life. We face MCDM problems every day and their criteria very often conflict with each other. MCDM methods have been developed to support decision makers to enhance decision quality. MCDM methods use various calculation methods to evaluate the rank of alternatives. Yet, little evidence could support that the best alternative chosen by MCDM method is consistent with the decision maker's ideal alternative in mind. Therefore, this study aims to develop an operational validation scheme to examine and compare existing common MCDM methods including TOPSIS, VIKOR, ELECTRE, the piecewise linear prospect theory method (PLP), and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in terms of effectiveness. Controlling variables include number of alternatives, number of criteria, distributions of data set, and the options between non-dominated data set, i.e., Pareto efficient frontier, and complete data set. We also add three different weight distributions, including uniform weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank sum weights, in these experiments to see how weights affect the MCDM methods. We test four different utility functions including linear, quadratic, Chebycheff, and prospect utility functions. Except the compensatory, non-compensatory and portion of compensatory utility functions, we also use the prospect theory utility function. In addition, the parameter settings such as normalization methods, distance functions, VIKOR's v, and ELECTRE's thresholds will also be examined. With the aforementioned settings, we compare the MCDM methods' ranks with decision maker's ranks by using assumed preference utility functions. Mean absolute rank differences statistical test are applied to examine the effectiveness.},

abstract={Cities are complex systems rapidly evolving in a context of strong interweaving between problems and solutions especially in developing countries. The architectural design and the city management processes are renewed by the eruption of sustainable development. These processes are multi-scale: new geographical, temporal and political scales are emerging, calling for new tools for monitoring architectural and urban environmental changes, for implementing comprehensive plans, or for communicating between practitioners. Number of communities in developing countries has taken initiatives to develop tools based on sets of sustainability indicators. But are these tools really helpful during the architectural design or the urban management processes characterized by complexity, fussy or lacunar data, various time and space scales and multi-actors decisions? We will demonstrate in this paper, that these systems, aiming at “a posteriori” diagnosis, cannot be used directly during these fuzzy processes, especially during their early phases very critical with respect to solutions. By adjoining them multicriteria decision support techniques, they may become powerful tools for decision support. Architectural and urban designs may be evaluated using a set of weighted environmental criteria and methods to aggregate the various dimensions involved. Some Electre methods based on the comparison between pairs of solutions have been successfully used in that sense. A step further away may be performed from decision to evaluation support tools, by comparing ongoing urban designs against convolutions of systems of practitioners' values. This “value focused” approach, combined with the Electre-Tri method has been successfully integrated for evaluating the performance of urban projects, according to their distance to various user-defined systems of values. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper aims to suggest a methodology able to support the analyst in the assessment process of items on the base of a criterion inspired to the maintainability parameter and in the successive assignment phase of the items in the predefined classes. The maintainability involves the continuous improvement of a system in order to improve the ability to maintain or improve the reliability of the analyzed system. In particular, the last one is the probability that a failed system will be restored to specified conditions within a given period of time when maintenance is performed according to prescribed procedures and resources. The faced case in this research regards the software maintenance, field in which the maintainability can be defined as the probability that a program will be restored to working conditions in a given period of time when it is being changed, modified or enhanced. Furthermore, the maintainability can be subdivided into diverse sub criteria as Analysability ( how easy or difficult is to diagnose the system for deficiencies or to identify the parts that need to be modified), Changeability (how easy or difficult is to make adaptations to the system), Stability (how easy or difficult is to keep the system in a consistent state during the modification process), Testability (how easy or difficult is it to test the system after modifications). Thus, with respect to aforementioned sub criteria the present research wants to propose the ELECTRE TRI method in order to assign the different analyzed items, with relation to the maintainability criterion, into the different predefined classes. With the aim to illustrate the method validity, a numerical application is shown with relation to the classification, under the maintainability criterion, of different modular Enterprise Resource Planning software systems.},

abstract={The model-based design of virtual fruit ideotypes using multi-objective optimisation algorithms could produce a high number of contrasted fruits. The breeder (decision-maker) will need an automatic tool allowing him/her to sort these contrasted ideotypes into predefined categories corresponding to several targeted traits. This paper aims to develop such a decision-making module to sort a set of fruit ideotypes into one of five preference-ordered categories in the context of brown rot-peach fruit pathosystem. First, a set of ideotypes with contrasted trade-off between three criteria was produced using multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Then, two multi-criteria decision-making methods (ELECTRE-Tri and DRSA: dominance-based rough set approach) were tested in order to reproduce the classification made by the decision-maker. Such a non-typical classification seemed difficult to be reproduced by the ELECTRE-TRI method while the decision rule-based method gave very good results (only 10% wrong assignments). The proposed decision-making tool is very useful to speed-up the model-based design of fruit ideotypes, i.e., breeding. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Multi-criteria decision making technique is a branch of operation research (OR), now popularly applied in the field of engineering, banking, fixing policy matters etc. It can also be applied for taking decisions in daily life like selecting a car to purchase, selecting bride or groom and many others. Various MCDM methods namely Weighted sum model (WSM), Weighted product model (WPM), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) and Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) are there to solve many decision making problems, each having its own limitations. However it is very difficult to decide which MCDM method is the best. MCDM methods are prospective quantitative approaches for solving decision problems involving finite number of alternatives and criteria. So the MCDM technique provides enough scope to be applied for the selection of vegetable dyes or ranking the dyes among them on the basis of some selection criteria. The present paper is an attempt to explore the scope of applying the AHP method of multi-criteria decision making technique to determine the quality values of the vegetable dyes under consideration on the basis of some important criteria like Fastness properties, cost & polygenetic properties and to select or rank them accordingly.},

abstract={Anti-jamming effect evaluation on Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) is an important issue for electronic warfare. Existing evaluation methods always use the change before and after jamming of one or more indicators (or characteristics parameters) to assess the effect of jamming, in which these indicators are obtained from 2-D ISAR image. Performance of these methods will descend if the quality of ISAR image is very poor or even the ISAR image cannot be obtained. To overcome this deficiency, a new comprehensive evaluation method based on Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) theory aim to target recognition is presented. Firstly, the evaluation model of ISAR anti-jamming is build using MADM. Then the evaluation indicator system is proposed. And it is made up from three layers of ISAR imaging, including indicators of signal layer, indicators of image layer and indicators of decision-making. Relative weight of indicators is decides by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm. At last the ELECTRE-III is used to evaluate the performance of ISAR anti-jamming. Simulation shows the reasonableness of the proposed model and method. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In manufacturing industries, various problems may occur during the production process. A problem is a complex status which involves relevant context in working environments. A problem-solving process is often initiated to create a solution for achieving the desired status; in this process, determining how to obtain a solution from the various candidate solutions is an important issue. In such uncertain working environments, context information provides rich clues for problem-solving decision making. Therefore, this work uses a selection approach for an optimized problem-solving process to assist workers in choosing a reasonable solution. A context-based utility model explores the problem context information to obtain the candidate solutions' actual utility values; a multi-criteria decision analysis uses the actual utility values to determine the optimal selection order of candidate solutions. The selection order is presented to the worker as an adaptive knowledge recommendation. The worker chooses a reasonable problem-solving solution based on the selection order. This paper uses a high-tech company's knowledge base log as the analysis data. The experimental results show that the chosen approach to an optimized problem-solving solution selection is effective. The contribution of this research is in demonstrating a method which is easy to implement in a problem-solving knowledge recommendation system for selecting a reasonable solution. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

This growth has entailed an extensive development of various wood types and methods in the construction industry. As a result, the design and conception of a building involve a decision with regards to the type of wood that will be used. Nonetheless, the contracting authority does not always have the tools necessary to support the choice of the best suited option. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria modelling approach for evaluating the available alternatives using Life Cycle Analysis and Life Cycle Cost. We use a hierarchical model of values to define multi-dimensional criteria. We apply the sorting method ELECTRE-Tri B in order to aggregate the evaluations and classify the alternatives in terms of their desirability in a sustainable development context. We illustrate the workings of our approach on an example. © 2013 Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The research project provides an estimate of forest biomass from silvicultural interventions performed by Ente Foreste della Sardegna in a Northern Sardinia public forest. The purposes are: to determine the maximum size of the cogeneration plant, to identify the best cogeneration technology and to develop innovative technologies for a cogeneration plant design using forest biomasses. In the current state the estimation of woody biomass, from which the maximum size of the cogeneration plant has been obtained, and the choice of the best cogeneration technology have been carried out. So it will be possible to exploit biomasses efficiently, that otherwise would be disposed of, with disposal costs, turning a cost into a revenue opportunity. Purpose The aim of this piece of research is the efficient use of woody biomasses from Sardinian forests, in a short supplychain for the energy production in cogeneration plants. The study concerns a preliminary feasibility study for the implementation of a wood-energy supply chain in the public forest of Monte Olia (North-eastern Sardinia). The energy could be used in a cogeneration plant to satisfy the energy demand of service buildings owned by Ente Foreste della Sardegna, within the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach Firstly we made the estimation of woody biomass, in order to verify the biomass availability for energy use. This analysis showed a positive result and we selected the best cogeneration technology for this application. Specifically for the biomass estimate, we made reference to a recent Italian method, considering sustainability criteria and applying geomatics to environmental and forestry data. For the choice of the cogeneration technology we used the Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM): a twolevel analysis has been performed by applying firstly the Score Method and then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); a second analysis has been carried out using the ELECTRE method and the results have been compared. Originality/value The current results and those expected from the development of this research have a considerable importance, due to the strong integration of the multidisciplinary components, to the design of the cogeneration systems related to the sustainable availability of forest biomasses, as well as to the correlation between the wood energy sector and social, economic and environmental characteristics of Sardinia.},

abstract={In hydrometallurgical projects, the heap location greatly affects construction costs and environmental hazards. Heap leach pad site selection depends on different technical parameters (topographical, borrow sources, hy-drological, hydro-geological, etc.) and other financial and environmental factors. In many situations, there are some proposed sites with different parameters, and it is necessary that the optimum heap leach pad site be selected with the help of multi-criteria decision making methods such as ELECTRE, TOPSIS, and AHP. In this paper, we have first studied the heap leach pad site selection criteria (technical, financial, and environmental) and their effects on the selection of the location of the heap leaching structures. Then, using the AHP method, the decision making problem was hierarchically structured at three levels. For analysis, use was made of the "Expert Choice" software. To check the practicality of the method, an appropriate site for the construction of the leaching heap was selected at the Taft area, Yazd province, Iran. Finally, sensitivity analysis exploring the overall priority of alternatives to changes in the relative synthesis value of each criterion was carried out for the main technical, economic, and environmental criteria.},

Work package 6 (WP6) and its team focused on carrying out research designed to establish a bespoke sustainability assessment framework and method for assessing the sustainability of noise reducing devices (NRDs) across their whole life cycle. This paper provides an account of the first study carried out to assess the sustainability of two built European NRDs projects (one in Spain, and one in Italy) via the application of multi criteria analysis (MCA) techniques. The general stages, selection of criteria, data gathering, and the use of three MCA techniques, SAW, PROMETHEE, and ELECTRE III, to assess their absolute sustainability is presented and discussed. The paper concludes that the presented case studies will provide a useful model for practitioners to adopt or amend to conduct their own assessments of NRDs' sustainability in the aim of supporting the growing transport sustainability agenda. The presented research could also support broader aims such as sustainability decision making, reporting, monitoring, procurement, the development of sustainability standards for NRDs, and for conducting "what-if" sustainability analyses.},

abstract={Prior work has been completed on understanding how an organization's decision-making approach can influence the selection of alternative vendors when setting up a supply chain system. Teams using different decision-making approaches on identical performance data did end with different vendor recommendations. One possible explanation of this result was that the data set on vendor performance was limited to five vendors and four variables; however the decision-making approaches had significantly different cognitive requirements. The team members preferred cognitively simple approaches such as Weighted Sum and to a lesser degree SMART with this relatively limited data set. The more cognitively complex approaches, TOPIS, AHP, and ELECTRE, had lower preference levels. This paper reports on an extension to the original work where team members utilized the same set of five decision-making approaches, but applied them to a more complex vendor selection problem. Results indicate that the vendor selection recommendations had less variability than the previous study, team members appeared more comfortable with their results, and better able to explain their work to managers when approaches that were more cognitively complex were used. The team members did report some time issues completing their work with some decision-making approaches.},

abstract={By analyzing the characteristics of the activities in POL support, the paper proposes novel multi-attribute decision making method based on criteria inference. The thresholds are used to evaluate the inaccuracies in determining the attribute's values by means of the pseudo criterion of ELECTRE III. The dominance attribute sets are constructed via estimating the outranking relationship between the schemes. For ranking the alternative schemes, the criterion inference is implemented using the out-ranking degree algorithm in Graph Theory. The study case shows that the proposed method could achieve multi-attribute decision making in POL support intelligently and effectively, because it has solved the problem in previous numerical models which depend on the exact numerical information gave by the decision-makers. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Companies providing occupational safety services in Croatia contribute to general safety in society. These companies are commonly small in size but serve a large number of clients. Contemporary business trends favour focus on the client. This concept is implemented in the companies providing occupational safety services as well. Client relations management involves creating a CRM system comprised of appropriate components. A study of the Croatian safety management sector identified the characteristics of the extant CRM systems. Based on the gathered data, a set of CRM practices was determined, identifying the most commonly found practices, offering as well a set of hypothetical but highly implementable practices. These hypothetical practices can without great cost be adopted by smaller companies, including those with business in occupational safety provision. They fall into two categories: one favours the traditional approach, while the other promotes the modern IT approach to CRM. The first goal was to evaluate alternative practices and the predominantly selected, usual and possible CRM practices. The second goal was to ascertain whether there is a CRM system and how it is formulated, using a subset of established practices. Furthermore, the placement of the standard CRM practices within the entire set of practices in occupational safety companies was also examined. Expert analysis relying on the AHP method helped to establish a list of criteria for the evaluation of the CRM systems, with weighted values attached to these criteria. Hypothetical alternative CRM practices were ranked using methods Electre I, Electre III and MAPPAC. Thus a predominant CRM practice was determined along with effective practices. Best evaluated were mostly the practices relying on IT. The listed solutions were analysed to see how easy they are to implement, and analysis was conducted concerning possible improvements in the actual CRM systems as found in Croatian occupational safety companies.},

abstract={A multi-criteria model tackled by an outranking method devoted to the sorting problem is presented to support decision making in assessing individual mental disabilities using information required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. This diagnosis process is a critical factor for adapting treatments to the current stage of the disease and improving health care and quality of life. The criteria required in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale have been considered as an input for developing our multi-criteria model, the output of which is the classification of each individual under evaluation in a pre-defined ordered class (category) as an indicator of the revealed level of mental disabilities. A method based on the exploitation of an outranking relation for the sorting problem is used to compare the individual information according to multiple evaluation criteria with reference profiles (specified standards) that define the boundaries of the classes. This methodological approach is substantially different from the ones based on the aggregation of the different criteria using weighted-sums to produce a "common value" measure. The method requires meaningful technical parameters, such as weights (herein perceived as true importance coefficients of the multiple evaluation aspects), distinct thresholds to ascertain the outranking classification, and a cutting level establishing the exigency of the classification. A realistic example using the decision support system Iris is presented to illustrate the results.},

abstract={Material handling equipment (MHE) is the most important part of today's manufacturing systems and is increasingly playing a crucial role in enhancing the productivity of the entire manufacturing organization. Use of proper MHE can aid the manufacturing process, provide effective utilization of manpower, increase production and improve system flexibility. Selection of the most suitable MHE is a very difficult task for the manufacturing organizations because of the considerable capitalinvestment required. It is also challenging to the decision maker due to the presence of many feasible alternatives and conflicting objectives. Different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have been observed to be quite useful to analyze and solve the MHE selection problems. These MCDM methods can evaluate and rank the available candidate alternatives based on various conflicting criteria. This paper mainly attempts to explore the applicability and potentiality of an outranking method-based MCDM technique, ie, ELECTRE II (ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality) method for effective MHE selection decision. Two real time examples are presented to validate the performance of ELECTRE II method. It is observed that in both the cases, the top-ranked MHE alternatives exactly match with those derived by the past researchers.},

abstract={According to the control loop principle, the so-called performance expressions identify the objective satisfaction, reflecting thus the impact of the launched improvement actions on the objective achievement. In a multicriteria performance and action context, the selection of the right action to launch is a cumbersome task. Industrial decision-makers require, thus, pieces of information about the satisfaction of the fixed objectives on the one hand and the potential actions to launch on the other hand. In this sense, they carry out more or less formal decision mechanism using their knowledge. In this study some reflexions concerning the relevance of the use of the MDCA methods for the selection of the action plans with regard to the performances are proposed. More precisely, the widely used ELECTRE and MACBETH methods are considered. These approaches are analysed, as they deal with human knowledge, in the particular case of an industrial improvement process, handled by the Fournier Company. Practical considerations are then highlighted by the application of these methods, in the kitchen and bathroom furniture manufacturing area.},

abstract={This work proposes a way to make existing fire risk analysis methods simpler to use without affecting the accurateness of their results. In general, a fire risk analysis starts with an established burning in a room of origin, i.e., the building location where an ignition occurs. The method then analyses things like the most likely direction that established burning will spread, rate of spread, rate of smoke generation, time people will have to evacuate before untenable conditions are present in the environment, the time the building structure will sustain until collapse, etc. The aim of this paper is to propose the use of the ELECTRE III multicriteria decision aid method, in order to perform the room of origin selection. The advantage of ELECTRE III is that it uses pairwise comparisons between alternative rooms of origin, so as one can select the best one according to predefined preference criteria. Each criterion is weighted to represent its relative importance according to the preference structure of the person performing the selection. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

abstract={We consider the problem of ranking alternatives evaluated on several criteria. This problem may arise in many real life applications like ranking countries, cities, projects, universities, academic programs and students. A number of methods have been proposed for this problem. ELECTRE, one of the widely used ranking methods, uses outranking relations between the alternatives. The main shortcoming of ELECTRE is its requirements of explicit definition of parameters which can be difficult for the decision maker to provide in advance. We develop an outranking based ranking method which requires only a subset of parameters and ranks the alternatives by mathematical models. A real life example is used to illustrate the method. © Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.},

The clinical performance of amalgam, except its unaesthetic appearance, cannot be exceeded by any of the proposed alternative materials for direct restorations on side teeth side. The amalgam, compared with composite resins, has a better durability and longevity, lower incidence of cuspidian fracture occurrence and recurrence of caries, and by improving its chemical qualities, clinical and adhesive systems; it certainly remains the best solution for fillings when restoring the tooth side. In this research paper, considering the research studies from the specific literature and the personal clinic experience, we are trying to present a comparison between qualities and defaults of the silver amalgam and composite materials-al leged ideal alternatives under such circumstances.},

abstract={The increase in productivity is an obvious objective for business, moreover with the research and development objectives set out for Barcelona 2010 and the Lisbon Summit. Productivity is linked to efficiency as enterprises have increased productivity when they need less input to achieve certain outputs or when they increase outputs with the same inputs. The objective for this article is to analyze the innovation efficiency in Spain by activity branch. To this end we will work with the 2006 data from the INE (Spanish National Institute of Statistics) innovation and R&D activities surveys. To this aim, we will use the following methodology for the efficiency analysis: the one based on output oriented DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with constant returns to scale. This technique will be completed in two aspects. Firstly with the introduction of more inputs and outputs without causing an increment of efficient units and, secondly the study will be completed with a robust analysis to improve the DEA discrimination capacity. © ECMS.},

To address this question, a methodology has been proposed, which is based on a characterization of the MCDA methods. The MCDA methods are characterized according to 1) sufficient conditions that allow their use to solve dynamic decision-making situations and 2) different other desired properties (neutrality, anonymous, fidelity, dominance, independence, compensatory level, conviviality, transparency, etc.). These properties might be seen as overall quality of the MCDA methods. This paper shows the characterization results for the following MCDA methods: dominance, weighted sum, lexicographical screening, TOPSIS, ELECTRE III, and PROMETHEE II.},

abstract={Even though gasoline reformulation has contributed in abating the high levels of some tropospheric pollutants in México City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), such as lead and sulfur dioxide, it is still being explored as practical alternative to alleviate other local air pollution problems, such as the high ozone levels. Because gasoline is a complex mixture of chemical compounds, the number of alternative reformulated gasoline fuels (RGF) to be tested is potentially very high. Thus, rapid and inexpensive methods are required to make such testing less costly. We report our experience while using a common ranking technique (Electre method) to select a subset of reformulated gasoline fuels (RGF) with low potential to form gaseous toxics and O3-forming compounds in vehicle tail-pipe emissions, so that further studies might focus on the most promising of them. Ten RGF differing in contents of sulfur, aromatics, olefins and oxygenated compounds were subjected to chassis dynamometer tests in two vehicles representing different engine technologies: Tier 1, as representative of the currently dominant technology in MCMA, and Euro 4 which will soon enter the local market. Emissions sampling was done at constant volume (CVS) using the Urban Cycle driving test, a standardized Mexican chassis dynamometer test that simulates the slow driving conditions at MCMA. All comparisons were based on the contents of regulated gaseous pollutants (THC, CO, CO2 and NOx), CH4 and VOC (HC and aldehydes and ketones) in the tail-pipe emissions. In tests with the local unleaded gasoline (n = 9), which was used as experimental reference (RF), the Tier 1 vehicle had significantly higher emissions of most measured pollutants than Euro 4. For selecting the fuels with lower emissions of toxics and O3 forming compounds, the emission data were normalized (0-100) and weighed by two external factors (w1, for O3 forming potential, and w2 for toxicity of each compound) and then subjected to Electre analysis. The best fuel options for data representing the average emissions from the two vehicle technologies were: F11 &gt; F6 &gt; F1 &gt; F7 &gt; F8 &gt; F12, for w1; and F6 &gt; F11 &gt; F1&gt; F 5 &gt; F8 &gt; F12, for w2. Thus, by both weighing criteria, the Electre method selected F11, F6 and F1 as the best gasoline options. The ranks of the remaining fuels depended upon weighing. F11 was formulated with low concentrations of aromatics, olefins, benzene and sulfur, whereas F6 had the highest Reid vapor pressure (RVP) and 370 ppm sulfur. According to these results, the MCMA's air quality may be improved by substituting the currently used gasoline, which ranked as the last option, by another such as F11, F6 or F1.},

Since even moderate fields mix eigenstates in these materials very strongly a differential technique is applied, where a dc voltage defines the field in the sample which then is altered by a small modulation voltage. The response to that modulation is generated from the most sensitive part of an electronic state, the envelope function, which facilitates the analysis of the spectral lineshape. The difference of the response of delocalized electrons in bulk semiconductors and spatially confined electrons will be elucidated, including the intermediate case of 0.1 μm-thick single crystals and field-localisation of electrons in a superlattice. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The complexity of decision making in industrial and economic fields is a phenomenon that has become difficult to surmount. This makes the decision maker feel powerless in front of unpredictable, non understandable and chaotic problems. The search for good solutions (strategies, policies, etc.) in relationship with timely and continuous events has led to the development of knowledge-based decision making (Kb/DSS). Kb/DSS is a computer-aided decision making methodology. Decision making embodies techniques based on innovative concepts capable of responding positively to the queries of organizations. The main objective of our work is the realization of an expert decision support system, essentially, aimed at financial investment. This system reives interactively on decision algorithms powered by ELECTEE methodology.},

abstract={The objective of this article is to analyze a marketing dispute for the future sale of electric energy among companies that generate energy and a company that distributes energy in the new private sector of Brazilian electric power system. Privatization of this sector in Brazil is based on the principle of implementation of competition wherever is possible, and regulation whenever necessary. That is how the generating and the distributing sectors are being privatized, while those sectors responsible for transmission remain under governmental control. According to defined criteria, the distributor considered various options to purchase energy. In this article, price and availability of energy to be offered were considered criteria or attributes for analysis and selection. The ELECTRE I and II methods were used. These are methods of the Multiple Criteria Decision-Aid (MCDA) field, based on the dominance relation. Results of both methods were similar: they favored the companies with lowest prices but with reasonable availability indexes. This is explained by the characteristics of the decision-maker who considers price as the most important criterion. However, it most be emphasized that the relevant criteria are defined according to the type of user to be supplied. The decision model formulation is presented, including the preferred modeling of the decision maker. The case study analyzed includes numerical results with recommendations and sensitivity analysis of the model. This case study is based on a real context of a power electric company.},

The reactive systems are specified with an asynchronous reactive language Electre the main feature of which is the capability of memorizing occurrences of events in order to process them later. This memory capability is quite interesting for specifying reactive systems but leads to a verification model with a dramatically large number of states (due to the stored occurrences of events). In this paper, we show that partial-order methods can be applied successfuly for verification purposes on our model of reactive programs with event memorization. The main points of our work are two-fold: (1) we show that the independence relation which is a key point for applying partial-order methods can be extracted automatically from an Electro program; (2) the partial-order technique turns out to be very efficient and may lead to a drastic reduction in the number of states of the model as demonstrated by a real-life industrial case study.},

This method makes it possible to automatically define the physical structure of a relational database. The input to the optimisation algorithm are the SQL queries stored in text files which are executed on the database server in a real life applications. Our tool recognises the classes of SQL queries and their frequency, analyses semantics and as a result prepares suggestions for the following parameters of physical definition of the database: the key and physical structure of a table (from amongst Btree, Isam, Hash and Heap), set of optimal indexes (this means their key as well as physical structure). The principal information which the system uses within the database optimisation process are: frequency and classes of SQL queries in an application and the data value distributions. The selection of the optimal configuration of the database relies a Electre Method which is a multicriteria optimal choice method. The use of these techniques increases the efficiency of the system first of all because it reduces the number of pages which are read and written to disks as a result of the optimal choice of the physical structures of tables and indexes.

The planning of a flood control scheme for a Sicily river is used as a construction of levees (for three design floods), use of existing storage capacities for flood impoundement and combinations of both types of measures. The considered set of criteria includes economic aspects and environmental and social effects of the proposed measures. A sensitivity analysis on criteria weights and on the model parameters allows to verify the ranking variations and to find a well ranked stable solution. The use of a modified ELECTRE I method for ranking of alternatives is proposed. as it is easier to understand by decision makers, while providing more stable solutions for the studied case.},

ELECTRE allows the specification of a real-time application’s temporal behaviour in terms of sequential entities called modules, of events, of relations between modules like parallelism, and of relations between modules and events like preemption. ELECTRE is based on a design and implementation approach enforcing the separation of the sequential part of the application (i.e. module specification), the event part of the application (i.e. event specification), and the control part of the application (i.e. reaction to events). This separation is also reflected at the execution level which includes a control unit, a module unit and an event unit. The execution environment is supplemented by a display system, which can be used for simulation, debugging or monitoring purposes. The display system is a multiwindow facility based on two main types of representations : a structural representation and a temporal representation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1991.},

Then, because of the possible occurrence of faults while processing, we introduce a backward error recovery scheme based on having recovery regions defined in the language sentences by the application's designer. The search for a recovery line when recovery is initiated is achieved dynamically, and so requires that a history of recovery regions and information flow between them be kept up to date. We describe it as a data structure and give the specific procedures that can act upon it. Furthermore, we consider the distributed implementation of our model. We study the solution of dedicating a centralized unit responsible for recovery: every site owns a consistent recovery-regions structure and is in charge of finding the recovery line. Finally, in view of permanent fault treatment, a reconfiguration-related issue is discussed.},
